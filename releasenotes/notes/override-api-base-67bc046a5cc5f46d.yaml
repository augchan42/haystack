    API_BASE can now be passed as an optional parameter in the getting_started sample.  Only openai provider is supported in this set of changes.
    PromptNode and PromptModel were enhanced to allow passing of this parameter.
    This allows RAG against a local endpoint (e.g, http://localhost:1234/v1), so long as it is OpenAI compatible (such as LM Studio)

    Logging in the getting started sample was made more verbose, to make it easier for people to see what was happening under the covers.
