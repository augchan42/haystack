War is generally not covered, only Allied World covers war that occurs during the journey, while AXA, Blue Cross, FWD, MSIG, STARR and Zurich do not cover any acts of terrorism related to nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or radioactive contamination. However, as long as the government in your destination declared the event as acts of terrorism, even though the event only involves common terrorist attacks like guns and bombs, there is still a high possibility of a successful claim.\nSelf-driving tours\nExcluded in third-party liability insurance\nMost insurance companies will offer third-party liability insurance but not covering self-driving tours with rental cars as the medical and personal accident benefits are only applicable to the  insured person. Overseas car rental companies would usually purchase car insurance for their rental cars, which already covers personal accidents, traffic accidents and third-party assets.\nRental Vehicle Excess\nIn case of traffic accidents, part of the repair cost may be self-financed, those are usually referred to as “Collision Damage Waiver Excess” or “Rental Vehicle Excess”, which is determined by the car rental company and the rest are compensated by the insurance company. For example, if you purchased an insurance policy with HK$3,000 excess and the car rental company has a HK$5,000 excess, you will be responsible for HK$2,000 and you can claim the remaining HK$3,000 from the insurance company after you return to Hong Kong. STARR’s “Essential” and “Extra” Travel Insurance plans do not cover Rental Vehicle Excess.\nMedical Coverage\nIf there is any serious injury that leads to hospitalization, you will have to pay attention to the medical expenses coverage, and check the details of medical treatment overseas hospital cash allowance and worldwide emergency assistance service.\n",
