    "content": "Most Hong Kong Travel Insurance plans provide coverage for personal accidents, overseas and follow-up medical expenses, and worldwide emergency assistance services. They also protect the insured from different types of travel disruptions, such as travel delays, baggage loss, and trip cancellation. Losses of personal money and travel documents are also covered if they are caused by accidents covered under the specific insurance policy. Other Hong Kong Travel Insurance protections include compensation on rental vehicle excess, theft of mobile devices, and personal liability.\nIt is essential to look at the major exclusions in the terms of the policy before purchasing a Hong Kong Travel Insurance plan. If the above situations are caused by events listed under “Major Exclusions”, the insured usually won＇t be compensated by the Hong Kong travel insurance company. Some common major exclusions are war, civil war, acts of foreign enemies, rebellion, military or usurped power, nuclear hazards, acts of terrorism, and pre-existing, congenital and hereditary conditions.\nIf the insured will participate in leisure and sports activities during his/her trip, he/she should check in advance whether the activity falls into the scope of “high-risk activities” that are usually listed under “Major Exclusions” in the policy terms, such as trekking at an altitude limit greater than 5,000 meters above sea level or diving to a depth greater than 30 meters below sea level.\nNormally, Hong Kong travel insurance plans require any activities in the air, unless an insured person is traveling as a fare-paying passenger in a licensed aircraft operated by a recognised airline, or participating in an activity of which the maneuver or navigation is managed and controlled by another licensed person and the provider of such activity, to be authorized by the relevant local authority.\nPart 3 : How to claim travel insurance online?\n",
