{"content": "7 ways to make passive income - make money work for you even while you sleep\nWith the cost of living rising, you may wonder how you can increase your monthly income to cope with that. One way you can do it is to create a source of passive income - i.e. making money while you sleep. Too good to be true? Read on to find out more.\nWhat is passive income?\nPassive income is money you earn even while you sleep. This can be achieved when you create something like a blog, an online course, videos, etc. that generate money even when you\u2019re not at work or through investments on property, stocks, funds, etc.\nWhy should I create a passive income?\nMost of us trade time for money by working our day job. But it is not always efficient and it will take up a lot of our time. We could have done something else as Warren Buffet is known to say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\u201d Also, we will all get retired at some point and stop receiving active income. Therefore, it\u2019s important to make your money work for you.\nPassive income ideas: How to make passive income in Hong Kong?\n1. Investing in Stocks\nInvesting in stocks that pay dividends are good passive income ideas. Good shares will appreciate in value and offer dividend payments - for example, HSBC Holdings plc (00005), Link Real Estate Investment Trust (00823), CLP Power (00002), or Town Gas (00003).\n2. Bonds and GICs\nReputable bonds and GICs do not only protect your initial investment, but also offer 2-3% interest rates in exchange for you lending them money, making them another great passive income idea.The return is not massive but the risk is minimal.\n3. Funds\nInstead of investing in a superstar company, you can invest in an entire sector or asset class, or on an economy by buying funds. You can do so by investing in index fund ETFs e.g. S&P 500 which tracks the 500 biggest companies in the US stock exchange instead of an individual US stock.\n4. Cryptocurrency\nInvesting in crypto is also a great passive income idea. Some service providers offer an interest if you deposit your crypto. But usually, it comes with a \u201clockup period\u201d, during which you can\u2019t access your funds for a fixed amount of time.\n5. Invest in Property\nIf you have more money, you can consider investing in properties. For one thing, it may appreciate over time and you will then be able to earn the difference and you can earn rental income each month.\n6. Saving Insurance Plan\nYou can also purchase a savings insurance plan that offers a potential attractive return to achieve long-term wealth accumulation.\n7. Affiliate Marketing\nTo earn passive income, you can also become a blogger and earn a commission for selling another\u2019s product or service. Most of the work will be done upfront and you will enjoy the income if someone buys the product.\nBest brokerage accounts in Hong Kong\nMore Details\nmoneysmart exclusive\n\ud83d\udd25Highest offer in town\nHuatai International Securities-Zhangle Global\nMin.
