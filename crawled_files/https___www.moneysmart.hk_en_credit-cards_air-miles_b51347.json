Among all of the air miles programs, you need to pick one that best fits your travel and flying habits. If you take a certain airline very often, such as Cathay Pacific, you may want to pick an air miles program such as Asia Miles. Here are the most popular air miles programs in Hong Kong:\nAsia Miles\nAsia Miles allows you to redeem flight tickets from a diverse range of airlines, including Cathay Pacific and Qatar. You can redeem travel, entertainment, lifestyle, and other rewards with your air miles credit cards.\nAvios\nAvios in British Airways Executive Club is cheaper than Asia Miles when redeeming short flights. Plus, they offer a household accounts program, allowing you to earn Avios with your family members.\nANA Mileage Club\nANA\u2019s mileage program lets you redeem flight tickets under Star Alliance.

But it\u2019s worth finding out the minimum amount of Asia Miles cardholders are required to redeem each time and the conversion fee.\nThings to Know Before Converting Air Miles\nAir Mile Converting Fee\nA handling fee of HK$100-300 is usually charged for each mileage conversion. Some airline or frequent-flyer co-branded credit cards such as BEA Flyer World Mastercard and Citi PremierMiles Card offer a handling fee waiver.\nProcessing Time\nPlease allow enough time for mileage credits to be credited to the Member\u2019s account. It may take between 4-6 weeks for the credits to be reflected in your account balance.\nTaxes\nThe ticket prices under miles redemption programs exclude taxes and other fees such as the Air Passenger Departure Tax, the Passenger Security Charge, terminal building charges, and the Airport Construction Fee. The final price of a redeemed flight ticket will be adjusted based on your travel destination, which will be deducted from your credit card. Please note that different amount of air miles will be charged depending upon the seasons by air miles programs (e.g. Avios and ANA).\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the best asia miles credit cards?\nStandard Chartered Cathay Mastercard (HK$2 = 1 mile on Cathay and HK Express spending) and Citi Prestige Card (HK$4 = 1 mile on overseas spending) are popular Asia Miles credit cards choices.\nAre airline miles credit cards worth it?\nYes, if you are a frequent flyer who spends with a credit card. You earn air miles as you normally spend. When you have collected enough miles, you can redeem a free reward ticket. If you are a lower spender, credit cards which offer cash back/ points could be a better option than airline miles credit cards.\nWhich airline credit card is the easiest?\nStandard Chartered Asia Miles Credit Card is the easiest to apply because it only requires HK$96,000 annual income and it offers automatic mileage conversion with no conversion fee. It also offers a relatively high earning ratio of HK$4 = 1 Asia Mile on dining, online and overseas spending. But this card is only designed for collecting Asia Miles.\nHow do I redeem Air Miles for flights?\nYou will need to transfer the points you earned to air miles via internet banking first, in order to do so, you must be a member of one of the participating frequent flyer programs. After that you will be able to search and redeem for rewards fights with different destinations, date or classes, for partner airlines that can't be redeemed online, you may call the service hotline or submit a request form to make a redemption.\nHow many miles do you need to get a free flight?\nIt depends on your travel destination and the season you travel. But in order to redeem a free return ticket, you need to collect at least 12,000 Avios points for return tickets from Hong Kong to Taiwan.\nHow long do my air miles stay valid?\nAirline or air miles co-branded credit cards will automatically transfer the earned miles into your air miles account. For other credit cards, you need to transfer reward points into air miles yourself via e-banking or by calling the customer service hotline. Some credit cards may set an expiry date for reward points from 1-5 years (usually 2-3 years). But there are a few credit cards that have no expiry date on the points, such as DBS Black World Mastercard and American Express credit cards, giving you more time on earning points for flight tickets.\nAir miles have their own expiry date as well. For Asia Miles, redeemed miles in the account will no longer expire from 1 January 2020, as long as you earn or use the miles at least once every 18 months. Avios has a similar rule which expires after 36 months in an account with no activity.\nIs there anything I need to know while converting flight tickets with air miles?\nThe prices of flight tickets under miles redemption programs don\u2019t include taxes and other fees, including the Air Passenger Departure Tax, the Passenger Security Charge, terminal building charges, and the Airport Construction Fee. The final price of a redeemed flight ticket will be adjusted based on your travel destination. The relevant extra costs will be deducted from your credit card. Note that some air miles programs (e.g. Avios and ANA) will set flight ticket prices based on seasons and charge you different amounts of air miles.\nHomeCredit CardsAir Miles\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
