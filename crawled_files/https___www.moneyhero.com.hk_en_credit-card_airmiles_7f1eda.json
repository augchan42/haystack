Cash Back Credit Cards Vs. Credit Card Points\nWhen looking for the best credit card(s) to help earning air miles, you may see other options besides mileage credit cards, mainly cash back credit cards and credit card points. Depending on your spending habits, you may benefit more from certain rewards programmes. \n  Air miles credit cards\nMileage credit cards are straightforward with their reward process and can be beneficial for frequent travellers as they usually do not require a miles conversion fee. \n  Cash back credit cards\nIf you don\u2019t consider yourself a frequent flyer but would still like to redeem points, consider cash back credit cards. Rather than collecting miles, cash back credit cards offer the benefit of earning cash back on qualified purchases, which can be useful for everyday spending. \n  Credit card points\nFor those who are looking for the best of both worlds, some credit cards offer points as rebates providing flexibility in how you redeem your rewards. Through spending in certain categories, you can earn a large number of credit card points that can then be redeemed for exclusive items or even air miles. \nEach type of card has distinct advantages and disadvantages as explained below:\n  Air Miles Credit Cards Cash Back Credit Cards Credit Card Points\nReward process Straightforward. Air miles are directly transferred to airline frequent flyer programmes after purchases. Indirect. Earning cash back on everyday spending. Some cards can earn air miles at the same time but at a lower conversion rate. Indirect.

Airlines reward you with points each time you fly with them, so you can eventually build up enough points to redeem incentives, such as free or discounted tickets or seat upgrades. Besides, some credit cards also offer air miles as rewards so that you can accumulate miles based on how much you spend on your credit card.\nWhat is an air miles credit card?\nAn air miles credit card is a type of credit card that allows you to earn points or miles for every qualified dollar you spend on the card. These points can then be redeemed for flights, upgrades, and other travel-related expenses such as accommodation. Air miles credit cards often come with additional perks and benefits such as airport lounge access, travel insurance, and hotel rewards. They are ideal for frequent travellers looking to earn rewards and save money on future trips.\n  How do you accumulate air miles with a credit card?\nThere are a few ways to accumulate air miles with a credit card. \n1. You can earn miles through your everyday spending on the credit card. Many credit cards offer a certain number of miles per dollar spent, and some may offer bonus miles for spending in certain categories. For example, for every HK$5 you spend using your card, you could get 15 points which you can exchange for 1 air mile.\n2. You can earn air miles through applying for a credit card and receiving air miles as a welcome gift. You could be rewarded with 20,000 airline miles after meeting certain spending requirements. For example, Standard Chartered Cathay Mastercard and DBS Black World Mastercard reward customers with Asia Miles upon spending a specified amount with their credit card.\n3. Some providers offer the option to convert credit card points into miles. This can be a useful option if you are close to reaching a certain amount of miles needed for a specific redemption.\n4. Certain credit cards may have partnerships with specific airlines or hotels, allowing you to earn more miles when you use the card to book with those partners.\n  Who can apply for an air miles credit card?\nEligibility requirements may vary depending on the specific credit card and issuer. In General, any Hong Kong permanent resident who is (i) at least 18 years old, (ii) with a good credit score and (iii) has a stable income can apply for an air miles credit card. Do note that some credit cards may require the cardholder to meet minimum income requirements.\n  What kinds of transactions are eligible for air miles rewards?\nAir miles can be earned through \u201celigible purchases\u201d. The definition of \u201celigible purchases\u201d will vary between card issuers and credit cards. Some credit cards may only consider local purchases as \u201celigible\u201d, whereas others may also factor in overseas retail purchases. Under most circumstances, spending such as instalments, bill payments, and autopay services are excluded. For a comprehensive list of eligible purchases, refer to your credit card\u2019s terms and conditions\n  How to redeem air miles?\nAir miles can generally be redeemed through websites, third-party portals, call centres or dedicated services. \n  How long does it take to convert credit card points into air miles?\nThe conversion time for Asia Miles generally falls within 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the partner's conversion process. However, certain selected credit card issuers might offer instant conversion. \nFor Avios, the transfer time from credit card points to miles varies depending on the partnered issuer's terms and conditions. For example, transferring American Express Member Rewards points to Avios typically takes 3 business days upon request, while other issuers may convert within 24 hours after a transfer is initiated. \n  What are things to consider before I redeem flights with air miles?\nThere are multiple factors to consider before redeeming flights using air miles. \nWhen redeeming points, remember that the number of air miles you accumulate doesn't equate to the number of actual miles you will fly if you book airline tickets.\nWhen redeeming flights, the cost of higher-classed tickets may vastly differ. For example, you may need to collect up to 15,000 air miles to be able to redeem a complimentary one-way economy class ticket, as opposed to 100,000 airline miles needed to obtain a one-way business class ticket on the same flight. \nYou may also use your air miles to upgrade from economy to business class, or business to first class. This can cost around 50,000 air miles or more, depending on the seat class that you want to upgrade to, and the airline offering the flight.\nSome programmes may offer the option to redeem points for a companion at a discounted rate. For example, your business class ticket can cost around 120,000 air miles, but if you buy another business class ticket for a companion, you can exchange it for only 75,000 air miles.\n  Will my air miles expire? How to keep my miles active?\nIn the past, air miles were normally valid for 36 months from the date you earned the point, but after the pandemic, there were policy changes across many air miles programmes. Cathay now offers a free-of-charge extension to the expiration date for Asia Miles earned before 1 January 2020. As long as you earn or redeem miles at least once every 18 months, all your miles will remain active. Cathay also offers the option to donate your miles to a charity instead of letting them expire.\n  What should I pay attention to when earning miles?\nWhen earning flyer miles on your credit card, it's important to evaluate the ease of accumulation, ease of mileage redemption, reward availability, and the possibilities of online scams.\nTo evaluate the ease of accumulation for miles, look at how quickly you can earn miles per dollar spent, consider factors like earning rate, partnerships, promotions, credit card options, and non-travel options.\nEase of mileage redemption refers to how easy it is to redeem your miles for flights and seat upgrades. Will the transfers be completed instantly, is redeeming points a hassle-free process, and is it done over the phone or online . \nIt's also important to check the availability of the reward. Some programmes may have limited availability or restrictions on certain flights, making it difficult to use your miles. Choose a programme that offers rewards that interest or benefit you.\nLastly, be aware of online scams. Some scammers may offer fake promotions or deals promising to help you earn more miles or redeem them for free.\n  Miles or cash back: Which is more cost-effective?\nDetermining whether miles or cash back is more cost-effective depends on your travel habits and lifestyle. If you are a frequent flyer who values upgrades and free flights and can accumulate a large number of miles through everyday spending, exchanging them for air tickets may be more cost-effective. However, if you do not travel often and prefer to earn cash rebates for everyday purchases, a cash back credit card offers flexibility and simplicity. You can use it for any purchase, with no limitations from airlines or travel agencies and brands. Remember to closely examine each credit card's terms and rewards structure to determine which one aligns best with your financial goals and lifestyle.\n  Why should I earn air miles with a credit card?\nAir miles are one of the common types of credit card rewards. If you're a frequent traveler and use your credit card to book flights and accommodation on a regular basis, you can earn more air miles faster, and exchange these miles for discounted flight tickets and other benefits. If your credit card is co-branded with a specific airline that has a frequent flyer programme, you can also choose to have the points you earn converted into air miles.\n  Are there annual fees for air miles credit cards?\nA majority of air miles credit cards do come with an annual fee. However, some credit cards may also offer additional benefits or rewards that can offset the cost of the annual fee.\n  Which airline air miles programs are available?\nCathay (Cathay Pacific\u2019s loyalty programme, formerly known as Asia Miles) is the most widely used air miles programme in Hong Kong. Many credit cards have partnered with Cathay, allowing cardholders to earn \"Asia Miles,\" the currency of the programme, with every purchase made. Two other popular air miles programmes are Japan Airlines' ANA Miles and British Airways Executive Club (Avios), which offer great value for group or family travel. Other air miles programmes worth considering include KrisFlyer, United Airlines' MileagePlus, and Korean Air's Skypass.\n  Do I have to pay when I convert my credit card points to air miles?\nCertain credit cards may automatically convert your spending into air miles without any additional fees or steps, such as the Standard Chartered Cathay Mastercard. However, other cards may only allow you to exchange your credit card points for air miles. In this case, there may be handling fees depending on the amount of air miles exchanged.\n  Do redeemed tickets include taxes and fees?\nThe cost of taxes and fees are not included in the redeemed ticket. You will be responsible for paying any applicable departure taxes, airport or government handling fees, fuel surcharges, security and insurance charges, and any other fees charged by authorised entities. These charges will be taken from your credit card when your ticket is issued.\n  What should I consider when choosing the best air miles credit card for me?\nWhen selecting the most suitable air miles credit card, in addition to comparing welcome bonuses and air miles rewards, it is important to take into account annual fees, APRs, penalty policies, and terms and conditions of related rewards. With a sophisticated credit card comparison tool like MoneyHero, we have simplified this process for consumers like you.
