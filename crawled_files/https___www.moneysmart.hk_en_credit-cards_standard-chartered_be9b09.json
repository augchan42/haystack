These are offered in multiple categories including dining, shopping, travel, and health. Some year-round highlights are:\nDining Promotions\nStandard Chartered credit card holders get discounts at selected hotel buffets, such as Crowne Plaza Hong Kong, InterContinental Hong Kong, JW Marriott Hotel Hong Kong. In addition, you can find deals at popular Hong Kong restaurants and takeaway outlets such as BLT Steak, Bee Cheng Hiang, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\nShopping Promotions\nYou can get discounts at selected retail stores in Hong Kong with a Standard Chartered credit card. Swipe your card to get discounts in electronics at FORTRESS and BOSE, and get instant discounts with a minimum spend of HK$500 on your personal care essentials at Watsons.\nTravel Promotions\nIf you\u2019re a frequent flyer, you probably already have the Standard Chartered Asia Miles Credit Card in your arsenal. In addition, you can make use of merchant tie-ups with popular travel website Agoda, Expedia, and Hotels.com to further get discounts and miles with your hotel bookings.\nStandard Chartered Cashback & Rewards\nAll Standard Chartered customers can earn rewards with all eligible credit card spending. Depending on the credit card you choose, you\u2019ll earn either Asia Miles (with the Standard Chartered Asia Miles card), cashback, or 360\u00b0 Rewards Points. Gifts and rewards can be redeemed via their online platform or via phone (restrictions apply - can only redeem air miles and cash.)\nStandard Chartered Cashback\nWith the Standard Chartered Simply Cash Credit Card, you can earn cash rebates directly whenever you spend on the card. With other cards, you can also get cashback with your 360\u00b0 Rewards Points - just redeem them via SCB\u2019s rewards platform. If you have multiple Standard Chartered credit cards, it\u2019s possible to consolidate and combine your cashback. The minimum threshold for cashback redemption is HK$50 per account.\n360\u00b0 Rewards Points\nIt\u2019s often more worthwhile to redeem shopping vouchers (instead of cashback) with your Standard Chartered rewards points. You can exchange points for gift cards at merchants like PARKnSHOP and IKEA which is great for families. Other shopping categories include electronics, lifestyle, and travel. Can\u2019t find anything in the catalog that you want? For a meaningful way to use up your rewards points, Standard Chartered actually lets you convert them into charity donations.\nStandard Chartered Credit Card Features & Benefits\nCredit cards are so much more than just a payment method these days - we also want them to add value to our lives with unique practical benefits. Here are three of Standard Chartered\u2019s best credit card features to utilize:\n#1\nOctopus AAVS\nSign up for AAVS (Automatic Add Value Service) to automatically reload your Octopus card balance with your Standard Chartered credit card. Not only do you avoid the hassle of manually topping up your card, but you can also earn cashback or 360\u00b0 Rewards Points with your Octopus card expenditure.\n#2\nThe Good Life Health Rewards\nDining and lifestyle perks may be a dime a dozen, but how many credit cards offer healthcare privileges like Standard Chartered? Cardholders can get special rates on health screenings, vaccinations, eye care, and even traditional Chinese medicine treatments.\n#3\nStatement Instalment Plan\nFor those who need help managing their cash flow, Standard Chartered credit card holders can split their shopping bills into multiple installments. The minimum amount for each installment is HK$1,500, and you can choose the repayment period (6 to 24 months) that works for you.\nStandard Chartered Credit Card Fees\nAs with every other bank, annual fees aren\u2019t the only fees you need to look out for when you get a Standard Chartered credit card. Here are three other common (but often avoidable) credit card fees.\nCash Advance Fee\nWhile you won\u2019t get charged for using your Standard Chartered credit card to make payment at retail merchants, using your card to withdraw cash will incur a fee of 3.5% of the cash advance amount or HK$100, whichever is higher.\nStatement Retrieval Fee\nWhether you are receiving e-statements or hard copy statements from Standard Chartered, it pays to file them away properly. Should you need to retrieve a past statement for an insurance claim or any other reason, it will cost HK$50 per copy.\nCard Replacement Fee\nBe careful not to misplace your Standard Chartered credit card, because replacing your card will cost HK$100 (per credit card account).\nStandard Chartered Credit Card Hotlines\nStandard Chartered has a number of enquiry hotlines. For credit card holders, the most important one to save to your address book is the one for lost or stolen credit cards: (852) 2282 1533. For general enquiries such as following up on your credit card application, you can call the Standard Chartered Credit Card 24-Hour Customer Service Hotline at (852) 2886-4111. Alternatively, try the Standard Chartered Banking Service Hotline at (852) 2886-8888 for other banking-related enquiries, including ATM cards. If your enquiry is not urgent, you can also chat with Standard Chartered\u2019s chatbot Stacy at the bottom right corner of your SC Mobile banking app. She \u201cspeaks\u201d both English and Chinese.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow can I redeem my Standard Chartered rewards points?\nThe easiest way to check, manage, and redeem your Standard Chartered rewards points is to log into Standard Chartered\u2019s online banking platform. You can browse the entire catalog and redeem your desired reward instantly via the 360\u00b0 Rewards Redemption Platform. Air miles and cash rebates can also be redeemed on the phone, via the 24-hour customer service hotline.\nHow long does it take to get Standard Chartered Credit Card?\nStandard Chartered usually takes about one to two weeks to process a credit card application from start to finish (you receiving the new credit card). To speed up the process, make sure to furnish all supporting documents at the time of application. You can also call their 24-hour credit card hotline to follow up on your credit card application.\nHow do I waive Standard Chartered annual fee?\nStandard Chartered annual fees vary from credit card to credit card, and annual fee waivers are usually granted on a case-by-case basis. If you get charged an annual fee, call up Standard Chartered\u2019s credit card hotline and find out if it is possible to get it waived. You would often need to meet certain requirements, such as spend a certain amount in a year on the card, in order to do so.\nCan I pay my tax bill with Standard Chartered credit card?\nYes, it is possible to charge your tax bill to Standard Chartered credit card, and then pay your credit card bill. This may seem like an extra step, but Standard Chartered has offered tax payment cash rebates in the past. That said, if there is no explicit promotion for paying taxes, do so at your own risk - tax payments are usually excluded from the list of \u201celigible\u201d spending for earning miles, points or cashback.\nHomeCredit CardsStandard Chartered\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
