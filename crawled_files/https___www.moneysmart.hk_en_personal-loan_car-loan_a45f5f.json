In the past, car leasing may be the most common option, but with more car loans available, you have more choices than you thought! MoneySmart has summarised your available options when it comes to buying a car:\nCar Loans\nThe vehicle registration document will be kept by the car dealer\nRequired to pay deposit upfront (applicable to rental)\nRequired to purchase comprehensive insurance\nRestrictions on car types and ages\nPersonal Loans\nThe final loan amount and interest rates will be affected by your credit scores\nCar buyers can keep the vehicle registration document\nNo restrictions on car types and ages\nShould I go for car loans or personal loans?\nThe application of car loans is simple. It is often taken care of by the car dealer. but the interest rate is less transparent compared to car loans and it has restrictions on the car\u2019s age. Applicants are required to buy comprehensive car insurance and the vehicle registration document will be kept by the car dealer, which is inconvenient. Conversely, if you go for personal loans, it provides you with greater flexibility with no restrictions on the types and the ages of the car. Moreover, you can keep your own vehicle registration document. You can also make use of MoneySmart website to compare the different loan products available before you make a final decision.\nUsed Car Loans\nProspective buyers may be worried that the car\u2019s age may have a negative effect on the loan application. But this concern is not necessary. Car loans do not have restrictions on the car\u2019s age. In other words, no matter if the car you would like to purchase is a brand new or second hand one, it really does not affect your application. But your application will be affected by your credit scores.\nCar Loan FAQ\nIs it wise to repay car loans earlier?\nIt depends on the car loans that you have applied for. In general, you are required to pay an early repayment charge, which makes it unwise to repay earlier.\nShould I buy a car with a personal loan?\nBuying a car in Hong Kong can cost a fortune from monthly repayment, insurance, maintenance fee, etc. If you don\u2019t have enough funds to pay in full, it is wise to take off some financial pressure by taking out a loan with a low-interest rate to fund your purchase. A personal loan offers better flexibility when compared to car loans, you can also enjoy cash rebates for applying a personal loan through MoneySmart.\nWhat documents are required to apply for car loans in Hong Kong?\nYou are required to provide proof of identification, proof of residential address, bank statement and car buyer's purchase contract to apply for a car loan.\nHomePersonal LoanCar Loan\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
