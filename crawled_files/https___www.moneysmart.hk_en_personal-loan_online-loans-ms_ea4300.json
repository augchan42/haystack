Usually, banks would only extend personal loans to applicants with a stable income and good credit history. \n\nWith licensed moneylenders, you can even get the loan approved and funds within minutes, and they don\u2019t scrutinise your credit history as much as the bank does. However, you usually end up paying higher interest rates than you would at a bank. \n\nSo personal loans should only be taken out for a specific purpose, with a focused plan on repayment.
