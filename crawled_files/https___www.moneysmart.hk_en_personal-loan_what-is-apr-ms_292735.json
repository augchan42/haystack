{"content": "All You Need to Know About Annual percentage rate (APR)\nTop tips for borrowing money? Don\u2019t only look at the interest rate! If you want to compare the true costs of borrowing, you should always refer to the Annual percentage rate (APR) instead of the interest rate. Not sure what APR is? Read on to find out more about APR.\nWhat is APR ?\nAnnual percentage rate (APR) is expressed as a percentage of the loan amount and it reflects the cost of borrowing over one year. It does not only take into consideration the interest rate but also all the extra charges that come along with the loan like late charges, administrative fees, etc. Therefore, you can easily compare which lender offers a better rate.\nHow to calculate APR?\nA simplified APR formula is as follows:  Interst Rate x 12 monthsx1.9 \uff08fixed number\uff09\n\nIn general, the lower the APR, the lower the borrowing costs are. For example, a personal loan with a 17.5% APR is cheaper than the one with a 20% APR.\nIs Monthly Flat Rate or APR More Objective When It Comes to Taking Out a Loan?\nDefinition\nCalculate the total interest expense for an unsecured loan Calculate all costs for an unsecured loan, including interest rate and extra charges\nBorrowing Cost\nNo,Cannot reflect all the costs of borrowing Yes Reflects the cost of borrowing over one year\nExample: If you are going to take out a HK$60,000 loan with interest rate of 0.5% and a loan set up fee of 2% for 24 months, you will need to pay:\n\nSituation 1: Considering Monthly Interest\n\nMonthly Interest=HK$60,000 x 0.5% = HK$300 \n\nTotal Interest for the entire tenor\uff1a24 x HK$300 = HK$7,200\n\n\nSituation 2: Considering APR \n\nThe APR is 13.99% in this case, according to the method specified in the guidelines set out in the Code of Banking Practice.\n\nMonthly Interest=HK$60,000 x 0.5% = HK$300 \n\nTotal Interest for the entire tenor: 24 x HK$300 = HK$7,200 \n\nLoan Set Up Fee\uff1aHK$60,000 x 2% = HK$1,200 \n\nTherefore, you can only get HK$58,800 (less the loan set up fee) instead of HK$60,000. \n\nIn the 24-month payment term, you will repay HK$2,800 monthly (See formula: HK$60,000 + HK$7,200/ 24= HK$2,800). \n\n\nIf you only consider monthly interest, you will not have taken the loan set up fee into account when comparing the costs of borrowing. \n\n\nAre loans with 0% APR the Best Loans?\nIn general, the lower the APR, the lower the borrowing cost. However, it is important to read the terms and conditions that come with the offer. A really low APR usually only lasts for a limited period of time or it only applies to selected customers.\nDisadvantages of Comparing APR\nSometimes, APR cannot accurately reflect the total cost of borrowing because the calculations are based on long-term repayment tenor. The charges are spread too thin with APR calculations for loans with short tenor.\nLow APR Loans in Hong Kong\nMore Details\nGuaranteed application reward HK$600\nCiti Tax Season Loan\nAPR*\n1.78%\nTotal Amount Payable\nHK$203,840\nTotal Interest Payable\nHK$3,840\nMonthly Payment\nHK$8,493\nCiti Tax Season Loan's APR is as low as 1.38%!\nApply Now\nMore Details\nBank Promo\nWeLab Bank Personal Instalment Loan\nAPR* (Inclusive of $3,000 cash rebate)\n1.28%\nTotal Amount Payable\nHK$203,840\nTotal Interest Payable\nHK$3,840\nMonthly Payment\nHK$8,493\nBank Promo:\nFrom now on till 31 January 2024, successfully draw down WeLab Bank Personal Instalment Loan using MoneySmart unique code \"NLSMRT\" could enjoy up to HK$3,000 cash rebate offered by WeLab Bank!\n\nOur team of seasoned experts are here to provide you personal and professional advice, so you can pick the best loan plan with the ultimate ease of mind.\nValid until 31 Jan 2024\nApply Now\nMore Details\nmoneysmart exclusive\nPrimeCredit Fixed Loan\nAPR*\n1.18%\nTotal Amount Payable\nHK$202,400\nTotal Interest Payable\nHK$2,400\nMonthly Payment\nHK$8,433\n\u3010 MoneySmart Exclusive Offer\u3011Up to HK$12,000 Cash Bonus will be rewarded for successful application via MoneySmart! \nValid until 29 Feb 2024\nApply Now\nMore Details\nmoneysmart exclusive\nWeLend Personal Loan\nThe lowest APR\n1.88%\nTotal Amount Payable\nHK$205,760\nTotal Interest Payable\nHK$5,760\nMonthly Payment\nHK$8,573\n Selected customers can receive up to HK$16,000 Cash Rebate upon successful draw down!\nValid until 31 Jan 2024\nApply Now\nFAQ\nWhat is an APR?\nAnnual percentage rate (APR) reflects the cost of borrowing over a year, taking into account the interest rate and the additional charges that come along with the loan like late charges, administrative fees, etc.\nWhat is the average APR of loans in Hong Kong?\nFor bank loans, the APR is usually between 1.3%-3% and for loans provided by Money Lenders , the APR is usually 4-7%.\nHomePersonal LoanAll You Need to Know About Annual percentage rate (APR)\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
