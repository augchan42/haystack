Typically provided by financial institutions, loans come with specific repayment terms and conditions. Based on the terms that you agreed to, you will need to repay both the initial loan amount and the accumulated interest\n  Types of Loan Products\nThere are various types of loan products available in Hong Kong. If you are looking to borrow money or take out a personal loan (also known as P loan) for a particular financial goal, you should try to learn and understand the differences between each loan product before deciding the one that is best for your needs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More\nexpand_more\nWhat is the repayment period for personal loan applications?\nThe shortest repayment period for personal loan applications can be 60 days, while some lenders offer a flexible repayment period of up to 84 months.\nWhat is the maximum loan amount you can apply for personal loans\nThe maximum loan amount you can borrow is typically 6 to 18 times of your monthly income, with a limit of HK$4 million. The actual amount you qualify for depends on factors like your credit score and income status, regardless of the lender's maximum offering. Banks and financial institutions may also consider your Debt Servicing Ratio (DSR) to determine the loan amount. In general, maintaining your DSR below 40% increases your chance of receiving a favourable loan offer. We advise you to maintain your DSR within this percentage.\nWhat is the difference between bank loans and loans from lending companies?\nBank loans and loans from lending companies are different in terms of interest rates, loan amount, eligibility criteria, repayment terms, and the application process:\nSee More\nexpand_more\nWhat is the procedure of loan application?\nThe process for a loan application largely depends on the lender and the type of loan you are applying. Some common steps include comparing loan options, checking the eligibility criteria and required documents for the chosen loan, submitting the loan application form and required documents, and waiting for approval. Both traditional banks and virtual banks offer online loan applications that can be completed through a quick and easy process on their mobile banking apps.\nSee More\nexpand_more\nWhat are the requirements of loan applications?\nLoan application requirements can vary depending on the lender. In general, most lenders typically require applicants to be at least 18 years old, residents of Hong Kong, and have a minimum annual income.\nSee More\nexpand_more\nWhat are the required supporting documents for loan applications?\nThe supporting documents needed varies depending on the lender and the type of loan you are applying for.
