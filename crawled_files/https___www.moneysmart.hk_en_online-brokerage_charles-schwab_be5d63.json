As a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), securities customers of Charles Schwab are protected with coverage of up to US$500,000 (including US$250,000 for claims for cash). Apart from SIPC protection, Charles Schwab also provides additional brokerage insurance through an agreement with Lloyd's of London and various London insurers.\nAre Charles Schwab brokerage accounts considered offshore accounts?\nCharles Schwab Hong Kong brokerage accounts are not offshore brokerage accounts. Offshore brokerage account refers to a brokerage account opened in a jurisdiction outside of Hong Kong. Offshore accounts are not for everyone, but they can be useful if you are planning to live in another country, study/ work abroad or access international investment opportunities. However, money held in an offshore savings account is not protected in the same way a local bank account does. Therefore, before opening an account, you should check with your provider to see if your money will be protected by a different compensation scheme.\nCharles Schwab (Hong Kong) vs Charles Schwab (International)\nInvestor Protection\nYes.
