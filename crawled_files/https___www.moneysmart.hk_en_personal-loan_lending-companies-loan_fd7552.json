There are now hundreds of money lenders in Hong Kong - that is, any company that lends money to individuals.\n\nFor those who have difficulty getting a bank loan approved (due to lack of income or bad credit score, for example), money lenders are an alternative, even though they typically charge higher interest rates than banks do.\n\nTo protect yourself from illegal businesses, however, you should only borrow from a licensed money lender that is registered with the Hong Kong government. You can find a list of licensed money lenders in the Hong Kong Companies Registry (www.cr.gov.hk) website.\nLicensed money lenders are governed by the Money Lenders Ordinance under Hong Kong law, which protects consumers and prevents lending companies from taking advantage of or harassing them.\nHow to compare the best loans from Lending companies in Hong Kong?\nThere are numerous lending companies offering loan services in Hong Kong, including personal loan, tax loan, debt consolidation loan and more, with benefits like instant cash delivery, no supporting documents required and loan approval on weekends etc. MoneySmart is here to help you pick the best personal loan from lending companies such as AEON, Promise, PrimeCredit, UA and WeLend, by comparing monthly interest rates, repayment amount, APR or more factors, to fit your financial needs in the most convenient way.\nLicensed Lending Companies VS Bank\nApproval Process\nLicensed money lenders are usually more nimble than banks, so you can usually get a personal loan approved by a moneylender sooner - which would be crucial if you need to borrow money for a sudden emergency.\nNo Income Proof Required\nIn some cases, money lenders don\u2019t even require supporting documents from you, which makes the process even quicker. For example, WeLend has a No Document Loan, where you do not need to submit income or address proof.\nApplication Procedure\nMany moneylenders offer online loan applications for customers, which is appealing considering how quickly and conveniently you can get a loan this way.\nCan You Borrow from a Money Lender with Bad Credit?\nGoing to a licensed money lender may be the most suitable option (or the only one) for applicants with bad credit scores. However, one will have to keep in mind that the interest rates from these companies are generally a lot higher than the rates offered by banks (due to the risky nature of these transactions). In Hong Kong, there are over one hundred licensed money lenders. The most popular money lending institutions include WeLend, Promise, UA Finance, and AEON.\nEverything you need to know about borrowing from Money Lender\nFlexible Payment Plans\nMoney lenders may charge higher APR than banks, but on the flip side, they usually offer more flexible repayment options, and it might make more sense to go with a money lender if you plan to repay the loan in a very short period (less than a year). While most banks charge fees like 1.5% or 2% if you repay the loan amount ahead of schedule, licensed money lenders typically do not charge such fees. So if your cash flow allows for it, you have the freedom to clear your debt earlier.\nLoan Amount Restriction\nMoney lenders usually restrict the amount a person can borrow if only the minimum documents are submitted.\nTerms of Agreement\nIt would be wise to spend time to read and understand the moneylender\u2019s terms of the agreement . It is important to find out if collateral or guarantor is required. You also need to find out if you will be penalised for making advance payment and the interest rate for late repayment.\nFlexible Payment Plans\nMoney lenders may charge higher APR than banks, but on the flip side, they usually offer more flexible repayment options, and it might make more sense to go with a money lender if you plan to repay the loan in a very short period (less than a year). While most banks charge fees like 1.5% or 2% if you repay the loan amount ahead of schedule, licensed money lenders typically do not charge such fees. So if your cash flow allows for it, you have the freedom to clear your debt earlier.\nPersonal Loans Eligibility\nTo apply for a loan, the applicant must be a permanent Hong Kong resident who is at least 18 years of age. Besides, applicants are usually required to submit proof of identity, income proof and proof of address.\nHigher Interest Rates\nThere are many benefits in borrowing money from money lenders but they usually charge higher interest rates than banks, anywhere from 6-30% on average, since they are less strict in requirements, the risks of bad debts are higher.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen is the difference between APR or monthly flat rate when borrowing from lending companies?\nYou should always use APR (annual percentage rate) in calculation whether you are getting a loan from a bank or moneylenders. Although you can easily calculate the monthly repayment amount using monthly flat rates, APR includes fees you may be charged, like handling fee, interests etc, which can give you a better idea of how much you will pay exactly to take out a loan.\nIs it safe to apply for personal loans from lending companies online?\nYou should always do your due diligence to protect yourself from online fraud and scams, though. For example, make sure the money lending site is encrypted (look for the padlock icon) and that the URL is correct. You should also read the terms and conditions carefully to protect yourself from unexpected circumstances.\nHow much can I borrow from lending companies in Hong Kong?\nMost licensed money lenders do not stipulate specific loan limits; instead, they personalize the loan limit based on each applicant\u2019s background, financial situation, and income.\nHow do I know if a money lender is licensed or not?\nCheck the Hong Kong Companies Registry for the most updated list of licensed money lenders. You can find this on the Companies Registry website. Should you encounter a company that claims to be licensed, you can also check CR for lists of expired, dismissed and withdrawn money lending licenses.\nWhat is the Money Lenders Ordinance?\nThe Money Lenders Ordinance is a set of laws that regulate money lending companies in Hong Kong. These are typically meant to protect the consumer. For example, money lenders are prohibited from lending money at more than 60% per annum effective interest rate. Moneylenders are required by law to follow these rules, but of course, there are unlicensed ones with illegal practices as well.\nHow to get a lower interest rate on a personal loan?\nIt is important to maintain a good credit rating, which will affect your interest rates. You can do so by paying off debts or correcting any errors in your credit history.\nWhat is APR?\nAPR (annual percentage rate) is your interest rate stated as a yearly rate, which shows your borrowing cost. An APR for a loan can include fees you may be charged, like handling fees. APR is important because it can give you a good idea of how much you will pay to take out a loan. The lower the APR, the cheaper the loan is.\nAre money lending companies legal?\nIt depends. The Money Lenders Ordinance is a set of laws that regulate money lending companies in Hong Kong. These are typically meant to protect the consumer. For example, money lenders are prohibited from lending money at more than 60% per annum effective interest rate. Money lenders are required by law to follow these rules, but of course, there are unlicensed ones with illegal practices as well.\nHomePersonal LoanLending Companies\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
