A basic domestic helper insurance only protects the employer\u2019s liability against a helper\u2019s expenses in relation to disease or injury. A comprehensive domestic helper insurance plan is considered as an umbrella solution, offering a wide range of benefits and protection.\nClinical Expenses\nIt covers out-patient expenses prescribed medicines and drugs from a registered clinic for sickness or bodily injury as a result of an accident. It also covers Chinese bone-setting, physiotherapy and chiropractic treatment.\nSurgical and Hospitalization Expenses\nIt covers hospital confinement for surgery or treatment of sickness or bodily injury resulting from an accident up to the limit specified in the policy. Employers also enjoy the enhanced option to cover cancer and critical illness.\nDental Expenses\nIt covers emergency dental treatment such as oral surgery, treatment of abscesses, X-rays, extractions or fillings as a result of dental disease. However, if it is not an emergency such as regular dental check-up, it is not covered.\nPersonal Accident\nIt protects the domestic helper against injury and death during rest days, which results in death, loss of limbs or sight.\nRepatriation Expenses\nIt covers transporting bodily remains to the country of residence in case of death or cover costs incurred to send the domestic helper home if certified as medically unfit to complete the contract.\nPersonal Liability\nIt covers third party liability caused by your helpers including accidental physical injury to others or accidental damage and loss to others\u2019 property.\nExtended coverage items of domestic helper insurance\nIf you would like more coverage, a comprehensive plan is more suitable for you. Although it is a bit more expensive, it provides extended coverage which is more beneficial to you and your domestic helper:\nReplacement Helper Expenses\nIt covers the re-hiring expenses incurred for getting a new helper such as airtickets and agency fees in the event your domestic helper is repatriated due to serious injury, illness or death.\nReplacement and Installation Cost of Main Door or Metal Gate Lock\nIt covers the replacement and installation cost of main door lock or metal gate lock as a result of the termination of employment contract due to act of infidelity or repatriation of the domestic helper.\nHiring Allowance for Temporary Cover\nIt compensates an allowance for hiring a cover in case of sickness.\nFidelity Protection of Maid Insurance\nThe compensation for fidelity protection of maid insurance is usually between HK$2,000 and HK$10,000, protecting you from the pecuniary loss caused by fraud or dishonesty committed by your domestic helper, such as unauthorized international telephone calls.

Domestic helper insurance policyholder must be the employer\nThe person who employs the domestic helper should be the one who purchases the domestic helper insurance plan. Otherwise, the domestic helper insurance policy becomes invalid.\n2. Waiting period\nMost domestic helper insurance policies do have a 2-week waiting period in place, from the effective date of the policy. During the waiting period, no medical benefits shall be payable. Therefore, it is wise to take out a domestic helper insurance plan earlier than later.\n3. Basic maid insurance plan provides limited coverage only\nA basic maid insurance plan doesn\u2019t offer protection against critical illness and other emergencies/accidents that your maid may encounter during the employment period. With just a few hundred HK dollars more, you can take out a comprehensive plan with extended coverage such as Replacement Helper Expenses, Fidelity Protection, COVID-19 Protection, etc. That\u2019s why it is wise to make use of comparison websites such as MoneySmart to compare the different domestic helper insurance policies available on the market before you take out a plan that suits you the most.\n4.
