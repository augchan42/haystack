Travellers may even incur additional expenses for accommodation, meals, or alternative transportation \u2013 which can be difficult to get back without the appropriate travel insurance for flight cancellations and delays.\n\nTo understand exactly the issues travellers have experienced with flight cancellations and delays, we commissioned a survey of over 700 Hong Kong travellers to find out which airlines they say they\u2019ve experienced the most disruptions with and how this affected their travel experiences.\nMost Delays\nMost Cancellations\nHow Airlines Handled DIrsuptions\nCommon Causes of Flight delays and cancellations\nDo I need travel insurance\nBest Travel Insurance for Delays & Cancellations\nWhich airlines did travellers experience the most flight delays with?\nOf the Hong Kong travellers we spoke to, Cebu Pacific Air came in as the top airline with the highest ratio of flight delays, with almost two-thirds (66%) of respondents who had flown with them in the past year saying they\u2019d experienced at least one.\nSecond was Air Asia, with 65% of respondents reporting a delay with them.\nThe airline with the third-most reported delays was Air China, with around 3 in 5 (63%) respondents who flew with the airline also encountering delays.\nSimilarly, half (50%) of the travellers surveyed that flew with Hong Kong\u2019s largest airline, Cathay Pacific, said that they had experienced a delay.\nHow long were travellers delayed for?\nThe most common delay duration for Hong Kong travellers was 1 to 3 hours (28% of respondents).\nOf the top 12 most delayed airlines, Bangkok and All Nippon Airways were the airlines that travellers reported the most prolonged delays with, with most passengers saying they were delayed for 7 to 9 hours.\nWho did travellers experience the most airline cancellations with?\nWhilst experiencing delays can be frustrating enough, having your entire flight cancelled can be a truly traumatic event, with entire plans thrown into disarray.\nExcluding airline cancellations due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Bangkok Airways took the top spot, with 61% of survey respondents who had flown with the airline reporting that they had experienced a cancellation.\nCebu Pacific followed, with 59% of respondents who had flown with the airline reporting a cancellation with them.\nThe airline in third place was Air China, where over two-thirds (56%) of respondents reported cancelled flights.\nHow long were travellers\u2019 cancellations?\nThe most common wait time for Hong Kong travellers\u2019 replacement flights was 4 to 6 hours (23% of respondents); worryingly, 1 in 25 (4%) respondents reported not receiving a replacement flight from their airline.\nOf the top 12 most cancelled airlines, respondents reported the longest waits for replacement flights with British Airways, with most waiting 10 to 12 hours.\nSingapore Airlines was the quickest to get their cancellation customers a replacement flight, with most (34%) saying they only waited 1 to 3 hours for a replacement flight with the airline.\nHow have the airlines handled the disruption?\nOver half (57%) expressed extreme disappointment with their airline\u2019s handling of delays or cancellations.\nAcross all airlines, 56% of travellers said that the airline staff were not as helpful as they would have expected, and another 54% of people stated that the airline was not very communicative with the handling of their disruption.\nPerhaps most shockingly, over half (56%) of the disrupted travellers we spoke to admitted that said that the way the airline dealt with their delay or cancellation has made them not want to fly with the airline again.\nHow often are airlines compensating passengers for flight cancellations and delays?\n43% of the respondents who had experienced delays said that they had not been compensated directly from the airline for their disruptions, compared to 44% of respondents with flight cancellations.\nWhat Are The Causes Of Flight Delays And Cancellations?

Amongst all respondents surveyed, 69% said they had experienced a flight delay, and 53% said they had experienced a cancellation. The survey was conducted online between the 5th and 15th May 2023 and all participants were 18+. All our data is based on the experiences, perceptions, and reports of Hong Kong travellers from the above survey group. Percentages of delayed and cancelled travellers for each airline were calculated by asking respondents to select all airlines they had flown within the past year and whether they had experienced a delay or cancellation with those airlines. All airlines which had less than 30 respondents flying with them in the past year were excluded. Those who had not experienced flight disruptions with any of the airlines they had flown with were then filtered out from answering the remaining research questions. Participants of our research were shown all leading airlines in Hong Kong, as well as smaller airlines too. MoneySmart is aware that this dataset is not conclusive to the actual data for flight delays and cancellations in Hong Kong in the past year that airlines may have recorded.\nHomeTravel InsuranceAirline cancellations and delays in Hong Kong\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
