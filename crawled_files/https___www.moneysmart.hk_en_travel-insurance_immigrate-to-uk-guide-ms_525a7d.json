You will be asked to provide your fingerprints and photo in order to complete the entire visa application process. Also, if you hold a BNO, EEA or HKSAR biometric passport, you are eligible to apply on the mobile app.\nTuberculosis test\nAccording to the UK Home Office regulations, applicants over the age of 11 must undergo a tuberculosis test (TB test) at a clinic approved by the UK Home Office to prove that they do not have tuberculosis. Applicants should note that the certificate is only valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray and needs to be submitted together with the BNO visa application.\nExchange a foreign driving license\nThe Hong Kong and UK driving licenses are interchangeable in the first year you move to the UK. In other words, you can directly use your Hong Kong license when driving in the UK for the first year, but as long as you have lived in the UK for 185 days, you need to exchange your non-British driving license for a British license.\nApplicants are required to mail the Hong Kong license to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The entire process does not require examination. Generally, you will receive your British license in about 3-4 weeks upon application.\nTax clearance\nWhen you resign, you need to notify your employer of your intention to immigrate, and allow at least one month to complete the entire tax clearance process. If you do not pay your taxes before you leave Hong Kong, you may be fined.\nYour employer will give you your IR56G form and pay slip, and temporarily withhold your final salary. To apply for tax clearance, you need to go to the Inland Revenue Department to meet with the assessor and file your tax return on the spot. If you need to pay back tax, you can pay in cash, EPS or through an ATM on the spot. Then, you will receive a copy of the \"Letter of Release\u201d. After the employer receives the \"Letter of Release\u201d, the final salary withheld before will be released.\nApplying for BNO Visa\nApplicants applying for a BNO visa can apply in person at the UK Visa Application Centre or via the mobile app \"UK Immigration: ID Check\" app.\nEligible BNO holders can make an appointment online first before going to the UK Visa Application Centre to apply in person (Address: Room B&E, 6/F, Lee & Man Commercial Centre, 169 Electric Road, North Point, Hong Kong). You will be asked to provide your fingerprints and photo in order to complete the entire visa application process. Also, if you hold a BNO, EEA or HKSAR biometric passport, you are eligible to apply on the mobile app.\nWithdrawal of MPF\nThe MPFA has announced that as the Hong Kong government does not recognize the BNO passport as a valid travel document and proof of identity, you cannot apply for early withdrawal of MPF with the BNO passport or its related visa application.\nOverseas shipping services\nYou can apply for tax exemption for the personal items you ship to the UK for the first year of immigration, as long as you have used them for more than half a year. Also, depending on the size and quantity of the items, you can decide which way is the best to ship your items to the UK.\nExchanging Pounds\nYou can exchange pounds through banks, international remittance agents or overseas securities such as Interactive Brokers (IB).\nDon\u2019t forget to get Travel Insurance\nAfter you have booked your flight or accommodation, the next step is to purchase travel insurance. In this case, you can still get covered for your expenses in case your trip is canceled due to emergencies.\nGet Travel Insurance Now\nUK Immigration - Which City is the Best?\nManchester\n\u00a3250,000\nProperty prices below UK average\nHigh-speed rail (HS2) will be completed in 2026.

The current minimum wage in the UK (National Living Wage) is \u00a39.50. If you don\u2019t mind changing your profession,  there are many job opportunities in the UK. For example, labor shortages are common in occupations like  truck drivers, cleaners, construction workers, butlers, nursery workers, etc. To find jobs in the UK, you can make use of recruitment boards such as Indeed, Reeds, LinkedIn, Glassdoor or CV-library. If you are looking for an office job, you can also try using an agency such as People First, Michael Page, Office Angel, etc.\nUK cost of living\nHow much does it cost to live in the UK? It depends on which city you live.  If you live in a first-tier city like London, the cost of living must be more expensive than living in a second-tier city. \n\nIf you want to save money, even if you live in London, you can choose to live further away from the city center (Zone1). You can choose to settle in Zone 2 and Zone 3, such as Stratford. Taking a two-bedroom as an example, the rent is about \u00a31,700 a month. If you're single, you can rent a  room for roughly half the rent.\n\nIt is not expensive to cook in London. If you are tight on a budget, you can go to more affordable supermarkets such as Asda or Lidl. Take a family of four as an example, food roughly costs you about \u00a3600-700/ month assuming you cook every meal.  Eating out will be more expensive due to the high minimum wage in the UK and the consumption tax.\n\nIn terms of transportation, as far as London is concerned, as long as you pass through Zone1, the transportation cost can be as high as \u00a37-8 per trip, but some jobs allow you to work from home, so you can save a lot on transportation costs. In addition, utilities and miscellaneous charges such as Council Tax (Municipal Tax) are about \u00a3400-500 a month for a family of four. Electricity charges in the UK continue to increase due to rising costs of raw materials. \nAsset Transfer - Bank Account\nAn offshore account allows you to transfer funds overseas for you to manage day-to-day expenses. To open an offshore account in Hong Kong, the threshold is often more than HK$1 million - which is quite high. However, such requirements for offshore accounts do not usually apply for securities such as Firstrade and Interactive Brokers and the whole application process can be applied online. With that said, it is important to note that not all offshore accounts are protected by US Securities Investment Protection Corporation (SIPC) Assurance Assurance. Alternatively,  you can open a bank account when you arrive in the UK, but generally, you must provide proof of your local address, so it could be difficult for new immigrants to apply.\nLOTR VS BNO\nBNO\nIn 2020, the British government announced that BNO holders and their families can stay in the UK for 5 years, during which they can study and work. You can apply for naturalization as long as you have lived for 6 years. Non-BNO holders can also obtain a Post-study work visa through studying in the UK. If you are sponsored by your employer and have an annual salary of at least 30,000 pounds, you can apply for a British work visa (General work visa (Tier 2) after the work visa expires). You can also apply for naturalization as long as you stay for 5 years.\nLOTR\nLOTR - Leave Outside the Rules means that Hong Kong people holding BNO and their family members can stay in the UK for up to 6 months before the BNO visa comes into effect, and can directly apply to settle in the country with a BNO visa for 5 years in the UK.\nGet Travel Insurance to Stay Protected during your trip!\nCompare Travel Insurance\nShould I cancel my existing insurance if I am immigrating to the UK?\nIf your existing policy applies globally, it is recommended that you keep it to get protection. However, if it is not, you can consider surrendering it. Also, please be aware that the UK charges up to 40% inheritance tax.\nShould I get medical insurance when immigrating to the UK?\nThe National Health Service (NHS) gives citizens free access to outpatient, inpatient, emergency and other medical services from a British family doctor (GP), but does not cover dental, ophthalmology or prescription drugs. However, due to the long waiting time, many Hong Kong people prefer to purchase additional medical insurance.\nDo I need travel insurance to immigrate to the UK?\nEven if you are an immigrant, the best way to get the best protection is, of course, to buy travel insurance. Once you have booked your flight or hotel, you should buy travel insurance. In this way,  you can enjoy protection in case your journey is delayed or canceled due to accidents.\nFAQ\nHow to immigrate to the UK?\nBNO holders and their family members can apply for naturalization as long as they have lived for 6 years. Non-BNO holders can also apply for naturalization through a General work visa (Tier 2) by studying in the UK and being sponsored by an employer.\nHow much living expenses should I set aside for immigrating to the UK?\nLiving in London costs around \u00a33000-3500 for a family of four.\nHomeTravel InsuranceUK Immigration: What to prepare, where to live and expenses\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
