The police report should include details of the stolen items and their value. If your checked luggage is lost or damaged, you should immediately notify the airline you traveled with and obtain a baggage incident report. When making a claim with the insurance company, you should prepare documents such as:\n\nPurchase receipts for lost or damaged items.\nThe local police report regarding the loss.\nReports from the hotel or airline regarding the loss or damage (if available).\nYour actual travel itinerary, boarding passes, or passport.\nWhat should I be aware of when I get injured or ill during my travels?\nTo claim reimbursement for follow-up medical expenses upon returning to your home country, the insured person must seek treatment for the same illness or accident during the trip and then seek follow-up treatment upon returning home. Be sure to retain all evidence, such as bills, receipts, doctor's certificates, or medical reports. When making a claim with the insurance company, you should prepare documents such as:\n\nActual travel itinerary, boarding passes, and passport.\nMedical receipts that detail the diagnosis.\nMedical reports, referrals, or discharge certificates (if available).\nWhen should I purchase travel Insurance?\n\"Trip Cancellation\" in most travel insurances has a waiting period and it usually only becomes effective 24 hours after the policy is issued. After the waiting period, in case of emergency, such as the death or severe illness of the insured person or their immediate family members, with a doctor's certificate indicating that travel is not advisable, you can apply to the insurance company for compensation for the non-refundable expenses. Therefore, if you've already booked your flights or accommodations, it's advisable to purchase travel insurance at the same time rather than waiting until the day before your trip.\nHow to make a claim?\nMSIG offers multiple channels for policyholders to apply for claims. You can process a claim by calling MSIG's claims service hotline at 2894 0660 or by filling out a claims form and emailing it to claimin@hk.msig-asia.com or faxing it to 2902 9500. Additionally, you can also apply and manage claims online. You only need to submit general and travel claims information, policy details, contact information, claimant details, and upload the required travel claim documents to apply for a claim. It's important to note that you must submit the claims form to MSIG within 30 days after the incident.\nWhat Are the features of MSIG travel insurance?\nMSIG Travel Insurance offers multiple plans to meet different travelers' needs. Whether you're a travel enthusiast, a frequent business traveler, a globetrotter, or in need of coverage for your children's travels, MSIG has corresponding plans to suit your requirements. Another distinctive feature of MSIG is that its travel insurance covers amateur dangerous sports and activities, including activities like hot air ballooning, scuba diving, winter sports, and waterskiing, among others.\nHomeTravel InsuranceMSIG\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Financial (\u201cMSHKF\u201d) is a Hong Kong established insurance broker licensed by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (license no.
