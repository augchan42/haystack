But in the event of injury or illness, will it be enough to cover the expenses?\nColorectal cancer, one of the most common life-threatening diseases in Hong Kong, can incur costs of between HKD115,249 and HKD217,491 at private hospitals8\nFootnote link 8\nMost medical protection plans have sub-limits on each medical service, and break them down into even smaller sub-limits. So if your treatment exceeds the specific sub-limit, you'll have to bear the remaining cost yourself.\nBut our VHIS Flexi Plan will cover hospitalisation and surgical fees fully without any sub-limits. Plus, the benefit limit resets yearly so you won't have to worry even if your treatment spans over a few years.\nLearn about covering medical expenses \nLearn about covering medical expenses This link will open in a new window\nBalancing cost and coverage\nSome medical plans offer deductible amounts. That means you pay for part of the medical expense, per the amount specified on your plan, and the insurance company will pay the rest.\nThe more deductibles you select, the lower your premium will be. This way, you can strike a balance between your budget and protection needs. You'd be considering any current or medical insurance plans you may have, and what you can afford if you incur large medical expenses.\nLuckily, you can get complete yet affordable protection with our VHIS plans.
