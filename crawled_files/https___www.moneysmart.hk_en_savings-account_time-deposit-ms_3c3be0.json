{"content": "Time Deposit Rates and offer: Best HKD Time Deposit Interest Rates\nTime deposits are considered as stable and safe investments as they give depositors regular and guaranteed returns - suitable for investors who prefer low returns with known risks. If you\u2019re considering opening a time deposit account and would like to find out about how it works then look no further. This article will give you a better understanding of term deposits and how you can benefit from them.\nWhat is Time Deposit?\nA time deposit is a bank account that gives account holders interest if they keep the money in the account for a fixed term. A certificate of deposit (CD) is one of these accounts. Compared to a regular savings account, time deposits pay a higher rate of interest. The longer the time to maturity, the more interest payment will be. If you wish to access the funds in a time deposit account ahead of its maturity, you may have to pay an early withdrawal penalty.\nHow Time Deposit Accounts Work?\nWith a time deposit account, depositors are committed to keeping their money in the account for a fixed term. The account will then pay interest on the deposit, and longer terms often means a higher interest rate. It\u2019s wise to shop around for the best rates to see which financial institutions offer the best return on your investment. Time deposit accounts provide banks with the cash flow needed to lend money to other customers or invest the money from the time deposit in other securities that pay a higher return.\nWhat is the difference between Time Deposit and Fixed Deposit?\nA term/ fixed deposit account offers depositors competitive fixed interest rates that don\u2019t change from the day the account is opened until maturity. Time deposit and fixed deposit can be used  interchangeably.\nHong Kong Dollar Time Deposit / Fixed Deposit Rates: Traditional Banks\nCitigold\n4.7% 3 months HK50,000 HK$195.83 (Calculated based on HK$50,000)\nHSBC\n4.3% 12 months HK$10,000 HK$38.3\nBank of China\n4.3% 3 months HK$10,000 HK$35.8\nDBS\n4.3% 3 months HK$50,000 HK$179.16\nCMB Wing Lung\n4.5% 3 months HK$10,000 HK$37.5\nBank of Communications\n4.4% 3 months HK$10,000 HK$36.6\nChina CITIC Bank (International)\n4.45% 3 months HK$10,000 HK$37.1\nStandard Chartered Bank\n4.3% 3 months HK$10,000 HK$35.8\nAs of 9th Jan 2024\nWhat is the fixed deposit rate on HK$1,000,000 or above?\nUnlock to find out the HK$1,000,000 deposit interest rate!\n\nSign up your MoneySmart account for free to unlock more exclusive content and be the first to know our limited-time offers.
