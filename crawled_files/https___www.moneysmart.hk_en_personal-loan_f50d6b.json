APR is used to compare different loan products, making the process of finding the right loan easier.\nMonthly Flat Rate\nThe difference between an interest rate and an APR is that the lender charges are added to APR. Therefore the APR of a loan is usually higher than its interest rate if it comes with lender charges.\nUnsecured Loan\nLenders approve unsecured loans based on a borrower's credit history instead of relying on the borrower's assets as security. Examples of unsecured loans are personal loans, credit cards, etc.\nSecured Loan\nA secured loan e.g. mortgage loan is money you borrow that is secured against an asset that you own.\nOverdraft\nAn overdraft is an extension of credit from a lender that is granted when the account has no or insufficient funds. This allows you to continue withdrawing money even when your account reaches zero.\nPoor credit\nA person is considered to have poor credit if he/she has a history of not paying his/her bills on time. Poor credit is often reflected as a low credit score. Lenders will use it for reference when approving for any loan/ credit card applications. People with poor credit will find it harder to get a loan or get a credit card.\nRevolving Credit\nRevolving credit is a credit account that allows you to repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and pay it back over time. Everytime you repay, it will replenish the amount available to you.\nTypes of Personal Loans\nThere are different types of personal loans catering to different purposes and varying in its interest rates and availability. Not sure which one is the best for you? Check out the various personal loans below!\nQuick Loan\nQuick loan products are created to offer immediate solutions for cash emergencies. It is often deposited the same day of the application being approved. However, they usually come with smaller loan amounts.\nDebt Consolidation Loan\nDebt consolidation loan is designed for borrowers with multiple loans. With debt consolidation, borrowers can transfer higher-interest debt to a lower-interest debt repayment by gathering all outstanding unsecured loans into one monthly payment to save on interest and enjoy a reduced repayment amount and a shortened repayment period.\nTax Loan\nTax loan is a type of personal loan available only during tax season with lower-than-usual interest rates. You can use tax loan for tax payment and other purposes including home furnishing, wedding, education, etc.\nCar Loan\nCar loans are loans you use to buy a car. It is often taken care of by the car dealer, and the interest rate is less transparent compared to personal loans and it usually comes with restrictions on the car\u2019s age.\nTips for Comparing Loans in Hong Kong\n1. Compare Annual Percentage Rate (APR)\nAPR reflects the actual expenses of your loans which includes interest rate, admin fees, handling fees etc. You may hear of Monthly Flat Rate which is only a calculation based on the repayment amount and not describing the actual monthly repayment situation.\n2. Choose the loan plan that serves your financial needs\nDifferent types of Personal Instalment Loans serve different purposes. For example, monthly instalment loans serve scaled expenses, balance transfer loans ease high-interest debts, and tax loans usually have lower interest rates. When comparing loan plans, you should not only focus on interest rates, but also consider whether they cater to your financial needs.\n3. Evaluate your ability to repay the loan\nBanks and money lenders issue loan amounts which are about 12 to 21 months of borrower\u2019s salary. The loan amount and interest rate are partly based on their credit score. Therefore, applicants with higher salary and better credit score may be given a larger loan amount. However, applicants need to consider whether or not they are able to repay the loan amount. To borrow or not to borrow? Borrow only if you can repay!\nBenefits of Personal Loans\nEase your cash flow concerns\nPersonal loans are a form of unsecured loans, which means you can get a loan without collaterals. Therefore, instead of relying on a borrower's assets as security, it is based solely on the borrower's creditworthiness. Personal loan is a good solution to cash flow issues. Banks and private money lenders offer loan plans with longer repayment period. Some of them are even up to 72 months. So now you are able to manage cash flow with higher flexibility.\nSimple application process\nAs long as you\u2019re 18 or above and having a monthly salary of at least HK$5,000, you\u2019re welcome to apply for personal loans. Bring your identity card, residential address proof, bank statement, and salary slip and you\u2019re good to go!\nApplying for Quick Personal Loans\nNowadays, many banks or money lenders such as DBS or Citibank offer quick loans with a fast application process. Borrowers can apply online and without having to show up throughout the entire loan application process.\nQuick loans are designed to be approved in a short period of time, typically within 1 hour.

MoneySmart Personal Loan Calculator helps you do just that. Most loan calculators online can only calculate repayment amount based on a static loan amount and APR, yet the APR of most loan products actually varies based on repayment period and loan amount. These loan calculators may therefore be unable to show the most accurate amount payable.\n\nOn the contrary, MoneySmart Personal Loan Calculator adjusts APR and calculates total amount payable of each loan product based on the loan amount, loan tenure and monthly income entered, making it easy for users to compare all Loan products with a more accurate total interest payable.\n\nPlease note that Providers have the final say on the interest rates they offer you.\nRead more on Personal loans:\nLow Interest Rate Loans in HK\nBest Quick Loans in Hong Kong\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat exclusive offers can I enjoy if I apply for personal loan through MoneySmart?\nMoneySmart partners with various loan providers to offer exclusive offers: New customers who successfully apply and drawdown Citi Tax Season Loan (APR as low as 1.78%) can enjoy up to $18,899 rewards!
