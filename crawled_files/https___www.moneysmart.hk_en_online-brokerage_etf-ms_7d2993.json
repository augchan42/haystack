ETFs can be structured to track anything from a particular index like the FTSE 100 to market performance, and from sector, commodity, to other asset, such as government bonds.\n\nConsidered as \u201cpassive\u201d investments, ETFs attempt to track the performance of a market index or pool of investments rather than trying to beat the index. Investors will experience a similar return or loss as the index tracked. When money is invested in an ETF, new shares will be issued. When money is withdrawn from the ETF, units will be redeemed. The ability of an ETF to create and redeem shares keeps the market price of ETFs in line with their underlying assets. ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange like a regular stock.\n\nMost Popular ETFs: HK ETFs and US ETFs\nPopular Hong Kong ETFs\nTracker Fund of Hong Kong Ltd\uff0802800): designed to provide investment results that closely replicate the performance of the Hang Seng Index\nCAM CSI300\uff0803188): aim to replicate the CSI 300 Index\nHSCEI ETF\uff0802828): seek to match as closely as practicable the performance of theHang Seng China Enterprises Index\nPopular US ETFs\nVOO: tracks the S&P 500 index by owning all of the equities within the S&P 500\nROBO: tracks a basket of robotics stocks from around the world\nQQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust): tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index including the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq\nStart investing in ETFs!\nOpen your HK stocks brokerage account via MoneySmart to enjoy exclusive offers!

For example, by investing in gold ETFs, you do not need to physically possess gold in order to invest in gold per say, making it a lot easier to diversify your investment portfolio and access a wide range of investment products.\nCost-efficient\nETFs unlock diversification for investors given the multiple holdings, spreading the risk of your investments. For example, if you buy an ETF that tracks the S&P 500, it is just like buying a small part of each of the index\u2019s 500 companies but at a much lower cost considering the commission fees charged for each trade and the capital required.\nDisadvantages of ETFs\nTracking error\nETFs may not track an index accurately as it does not always hold every asset in the index it is trying to track, resulting in a tracking error between the ETF\u2019s performance and that of the index.\nCurrency risk\nETFs traded in a different currency can expose you to currency risk. The exchange rate movements may affect the value of shares that are bought and sold in that currency. For example, if you buy an ETF that invests in Japanese stocks, you will see the value of your ETF change not only if the price of the stocks changes, but also if the exchange rate between HKD and Yen changes.\nVulnerable to market volatility\nAll investments carry risks and ETFs are no exception. It is important to know that investing in ETFs does not necessarily guarantee returns. It could result in loss if the broad market index e.g. S&P 500 that it tracks is down so it is still vulnerable to market volatility.\nCompare your US stock accounts now to buy US stock ETFs!\nLooking at the historical prices of many US stock ETFs, they have gone up steadily over the last 5 years.

It's a good alternative to short selling.\nWho is ETF for?\nAs there will be brokerage commissions involved every time you trade, ETFs may be better suited for a buy-and-hold investor or someone who does not wish to actively manage their investment portfolio or who wish to access a particular investment but find it difficult to e.g. gold.\nHow to buy ETF?\nStep 1\nCreate a brokerage account\nETFs can be traded through online brokers. A brokerage account allows you to trade ETFs, stocks and other investment products.\nStep 2\nFund the account\nAfter you have created a brokerage account, you will need to fund the account before you can start investing in ETFs.

Since ETFs are traded directly on an exchange, brokerage commissions are usually incurred. It is important for investors to compare the brokerage fees, which can become an issue if an investor deposits small amounts of capital on a regular basis into an ETF leveraging on the \"dollar cost averaging strategy\".\nFurther reading\nLooking to read more investment and wealth management related articles?
