If the repayments slip through, the lender can repossess the property and sell it. To avoid this from happening, it is important for mortgage borrowers to compare different mortgage offers and pick the one that is affordable. \n\nHIBOR Rate (known as H Plan) is the benchmark interest rate for lending between banks within the Hong Kong market while Prime Rate (known as P Plan) is decided by individual banks. H Plan is reflective of the borrowing costs, so it fluctuates on a daily basis. A few years ago, HIBOR was low, so many applicants preferred H Plan over P Plan. However, HIBOR has increased a lot in recent years and many mortgage borrowers end up using the capped mortgage rate to repay their monthly mortgage. Given this situation, the interest rate of H Plan and P Plan are much closer now. \n\nIf you are like most people, you are very likely to be time deprived to conduct all the research on mortgage yourself. That\u2019s where MoneySmart comes in. We provide free valuation and application service. You can apply for an array of plans and the application results will be available in just 9 working days.

The 2019 Policy Address has relaxed the mortgage policy in Hong Kong, allowing first-time buyers to take out loans with 90% loan-to-value ratio for properties worth as much as HK$8,000,000, which makes second-hand property more popular.\nVillage House Mortgage\nVillage houses are more complex for loan application as it usually takes a bank longer to investigate the title, permitted uses, legality of construction, encumbrances and easements. Moreover, transaction volumes of village houses are thinner, resulting in down-valuation. The maximum LTV ratio is usually 50%-60%. First-time buyers may be able to obtain further financing through Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP). If the applicant qualifies financially, some banks are willing to offer up to 85% LTV ratio.Moreover, mortgage borrowers can choose H Plan or P Plan.\nUncompleted Buildings Mortgage\nOnly stage payment plan (i.e. repayment only begins when the buildings are completed) is applicable for 90% LTV ratio while the cash payment plan (i.e. repayment begins before the buildings are completed) is not applicable for 90% LTV ratio. Property developers usually provide attractive offers to buyers who start the cash payment plan but it comes with risks as the buildings are not completed.\nTong Lau Mortgage\nThe property price of tong lau (old building) is usually a lot cheaper. It is worth around HK$2,000,000. First-time buyers can obtain further financing through the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) though mortgage borrowers could usually only get up to 60% LTV ratio as it may involve illegal structure or subdivided units. Moreover, the age of these buildings is usually quite old, ending up with a short mortgage term.\nPublic Housing Mortgage\nPublic housing owners can apply for a mortgage of 95% or even 100% LTV ratio and the maximum repayment period is 25 years. Moreover, mortgage borrowers are exempt from the stress test, and the interest is the same as that of a private property. You can repay by H or P. If the public housing unit is resold within five years, it is subject to more restrictions. If it is beyond 5 years, the owner can sell the unit in the open market.\nCommercial Buildings Mortgage\nSince it is not residential buildings, banks tend to be more conservative in their valuations of these buildings, and according to current regulations, all non-residential units can only get up to 40% LTV ratio. The current additional stamp duty (SSD) and buyer stamp duty (BSD) applicable to residential buildings are not applicable to industrial buildings. In terms of tenure, the maximum period of mortgage for industrial buildings is 20 years. However, if the applicant is too old or the age of the building is too old, it will not be possible to obtain 20 years of mortgage term.\nCar Park Mortgage\nCar parking mortgages are different from residential property mortgages in terms of LTV ratio, interest rate and repayment period. If you do not have other mortgage properties at the time of application, the LTV ratio is 50% with a maximum repayment period of 15 years.\nForeclosure Mortgage\nOccasionally, there are foreclosure buildings for sale in the market. If it was only because the original owner was unable to repay the mortgage due to debt problems, then it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to obtain a mortgage. However, if it involves unauthorized construction, loss of property deeds, unclear title, etc., the mortgage will be affected. Therefore, it is important to conduct thorough research before purchasing.\nContact a MoneySmart Mortgage Specialist\nContact Now\nMortgage for different types of applicants\nFirst-time home buyers\nFirst-time home buyers (i.e. homebuyers who are not currently owning another property) are able to borrow up to 90 % of a property's value to a maximum of HK$8 million, from HK$4 million previously with mortgage insurance. That means first-time home buyers can buy more expensive homes with a down payment of just 10%\nNon first-time home buyers\nNon first-time homebuyers are required to pass the stress test and the maximum LTV is 80%. Stress test is calculated at the current interest rate plus 3%. To pass the test, it requires the applicant\u2019s DSR to be less than 60%.\nHomebuyers looking to switch homes\nIf you are switching homes and wonder if you still enjoy first-time buyer status, it will depend on whether the credit history of your old property is still in your TransUnion report at the time of signing the formal agreement for sale and purchase.\nCivil Servants\nCivil servants enjoy non-accountable cash allowance schemes to subsidise their mortgage for up to 10 years, according to terms of appointment, length of service, salary, etc. This subsidy can be taken into account together with your monthly income when taking the stress test.\nSelf-employed/ Applicants with No Fixed Income\nSelf-employed applicants with no fixed-income usually need to go through a more stringent application process e.g. providing income proof for a longer period of time and undergoing a stricter stress test to prove an individual\u2019s ability to repay. It is less likely that 90% LTV will be approved for these applicants.\nMortgage Rates, Stamp Duty and Lawyer Fees\nMortgage Rates\nThere are mainly two types of mortgage rates, namely HIBOR Rate and Prime-based Rate in Hong Kong.\nHIBOR Rate (known as H Plan) is the benchmark interest rate for lending among banks while Prime-based rate (known as P Plan) is decided by individual banks. H Plan comes with a cap limit to ensure you rate protection in case of fluctuations. For example, if H is H+1.1% with HIBOR as 0.5 and P-2.5% as cap limit, the interest rate ranges from 1.6% to 2.5%. From historical record, H Plan usually offers better interest rates. Even if it goes up, it comes down quickly and it almost never hits the rate of P Plan.\nStamp Duty\nStamp duty refers to the tax payable to the government for selling or buying properties.\nThere are 3 main types of stamp duties:\nAd Valorem Stamp Duty (AVD) for Residential Property\nNon-Residential Property Special Stamp Duty (SSD)\nBuyer\u2019s Stamp Duty (BSD).\n\nHong Kong permanent residents who are first-time buyers are exempted from most of the stamp duties. Both Hong Kong permanent residents who are purchasing their first homes or switching homes are required to pay AVD at the time of purchase. If you are first-time buyers, the rate is 3%. If not, it is 15%. Moreover, special Stamp Duty (SSD) applies to any properties resold within 36 months or less to curb house flipping and BSD is an additional upfront tax on non-permanent-resident buyers.\nLawyer Fee\nBuying a property involves a lot of legal procedure and documents, including confirming the title, signing of formal agreement for sale and purchase, deed execution, etc. It usually costs a few thousands. If it is more complicated involved, the fee will go up. It is wise to agree the fee with your lawyer first before you commission them to deal with the conveyance.\nHow do I choose a Mortgage Plan?\nHow to calculate Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio?\nLTV ratio is calculated based on dividing the loan amount by the appraised value of the property. For example, if a mortgage borrower has taken out a loan of HK$5,000,000 for a property that worth HK$8,000,000. The LTV ratio is 62.5%. LTV ratio is affected by a number of factors. MoneySmart has put together 6 factors that affect LTV ratio for your quick reference:\nApplicant\u2019s age\nThe maximum mortgage term is usually calculated by \u201875-applicant\u2019s age\u2019.

However, some banks may offer \u201880-applicant\u2019s age\u2019 or even \u201885-applicant\u2019s age\u2019 with a higher interest rate.\nAge of the property\nThe maximum mortgage term is usually calculated by \u201875- age of the property\u2019.
