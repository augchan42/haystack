HSBC has based this list on information obtained from sources it believes to be reliable but which it has not independently verified. HSBC makes no guarantee, representation or warranty and accepts no responsibility or liability as to its accuracy or completeness. The information is subject to change without notice.\nThe performance information presented is not indicative of future performance.\n  Risk disclosure \u2013 Bonds / CDs\nBonds / CDs are mainly medium to long-term fixed income products, not for short-term speculation. You should be prepared to hold your bonds / CDs for the full tenor; you could lose part or all of your principal if you choose to sell the bond / CD prior to maturity.\nIt is the issuer who pays interest and repays principal of bonds / CDs. If the issuer of your bond / CD defaults, you might not be able to receive back the interest and principal. You bear the credit risk of the issuer and have no recourse to HSBC unless HSBC is the issuer itself.\nIndicative prices of bonds / CDs are available, but prices will fluctuate with market changes. Factors affecting market price of bonds / CD include, and are not limited to, fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, and liquidity premiums. The fluctuation in yield generally has a greater effect on prices of longer tenor bonds / CDs. There is an inherent risk that losses may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling bonds / CDs.\nIf you wish to sell bonds / CDs, HSBC may repurchase it based on the prevailing market price under normal market circumstances, but the selling price may differ from the original buying price due to changes in market conditions.\nThere may be exchange rate risks if you choose to convert payments made on bonds / CDs to your home currency.\nThe secondary market for bonds / CDs may not provide significant liquidity or may trade at prices based on the prevailing market conditions and may not be in line with the expectations of holders of bonds / CDs.\nIf the bonds / CDs are redeemed early, you might not receive the same rates of return when you use the funds to purchase other products.\n  Risk disclosure \u2013 Renminbi ('RMB') related products\nThere may be exchange rate risks if you choose to convert RMB payments made on the bonds to your home currency.\nRMB debt instruments are subject to interest rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect the return and performance of the RMB products.\nRMB products may suffer significant losses in liquidating the underlying investments if such investments do not have an active secondary market and their prices have large bid-offer spreads.\nYou could lose part or all of your principal if you choose to sell your RMB bonds prior to maturity.\n  Important note\nEffective as of 10 December 2018, the settlement day of the Singapore securities markets is 2 business days after trade execution day (T+2). For buy orders, the debit of the purchase amount from your account and deposit of the purchased securities will take 2 business days after trade execution day. For sell orders, sales proceeds will be credited to your account 2 business days after sale execution day.\nNote: The actual settlement date is subject to market arrangement which may be beyond the stated date due to different lead time required or suspension of business or trading.\n  Financial regulations\nThe Central Securities Depositories Regulation No 909/2014 (CSDR) is a European Union regulation that aims to improve the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures within the European Economic Area (EEA).\nCSDR is a phased regulation and most of its provisions have already been implemented since it was first introduced in 2014.\nAs a direct participant in European Economic Area (EEA) Central Securities Depositories (CSD), we are required, under the European Union (EU) Central Securities Depositories Regulations (CSDR), to (i) offer our customers whose securities are held through the EEA CSD the choice between an Omnibus Client Segregated Account (OSA) and an Individual Client Segregated Account (ISA), and (ii) publicly disclose the level of protection and the costs associated with the different levels of segregation that the accounts provide.

Its main objective is to incentivise timely settlements by introducing a set of measures to prevent, monitor and address settlement fails. This may include the following:\nProcess and system enhancements across the EEA CSDs and market participants\nThe introduction of cash penalties against parties causing settlement fails\nThe introduction of mandatory buy-ins, whereby buying parties whose instruments have not been delivered for a set number of days are to be restored to the economic position as if the transaction had settled on time\n  To understand the potential implications of CSDR SDR for HSBC and our customers, you can read more about the measures to prevent and monitor settlement fails (PDF)\nmeasures to prevent and monitor settlement fails (PDF) This link will open in a new window\nor visit our frequently asked questions about financial regulations.\nBack to top \n\u00a9 Copyright.
