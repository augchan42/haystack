The charge ranges from 1-2%, depending on the card issuer. JCB charges 1-1.95%, American Express charges 2% while Visa/ Mastercard issued by local banks charge 1.95% for each foreign transaction.\nWhile most of the Union Pay credit cards (excluding Hang Seng and HSBC) exempt cardholders from overseas charges, the exchange rate is usually higher than Visa/ Mastercard. Moreover, the rewards of Visa/Mastercard are often more attractive. Therefore, when deciding which credit card to use during your travel, it is not wise to only consider the transaction fee. It is best to consider all factors including transaction fee, exchange rate, card rebate, etc. to be smart with money.\nCredit Card Overseas Charges- DCC Markup Fee\nCredit card overseas charges do not only apply to foreign transactions made in foreign countries while travelling, and it also applies to transactions made online from your home country where the vendor is in an oversea country. Very often, merchants will provide you with the option to either pay in local currency or Hong Kong currency. If you decide to pay in Hong Kong currency, you will be charged at least a 4% DCC markup fee (Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) Service Charges). To avoid that, you should always pay in local currencies wherever possible.\nCredit Card Travel Promotions\nHang Seng Credit Card\nFrom now until 31 December 2022, spend HK$5,000 or above with the registered Hang Seng Credit Card including Hang Seng Visa Infinite Card / Hang Seng Prestige World to enjoy up to 6% Cash Dollars rebate.\nBOC Credit Card\nWith BOC Travel Rewards Visa Signature Card, you can enjoy up to 8% rebate for overseas spending throughout the year, and a maximum of HK$500 cash rebate per month.\nThings you need to know about credit cards for foreign transactions\nLocation Limits\nVisa/ Mastercard are accepted worldwide while UnionPay is widely accepted in Asia but not in the US or Europe. It is best to check with your card issuer before travelling to make sure that your card is accepted.\nUnionPay may not be the best option\nAlthough most UnionPay credit cards offer handling fee waiver while Visa/ Mastercard charges 1.95% handling fee, it is not necessarily the most money-saving. Cardholders need to take exchange rates and rebate/mile conversion rates into account.\nTravel/ Overseas Spending Credit Cards Frequently Asked Questions\nAre there any charges using UnionPay credit cards overseas?\nMost of the Union Pay credit cards offer overseas charges waiver except for those issued by Hang Seng and HSBC.\nWhat currency should I use in foreign transactions?\nWhen using a credit card overseas, it's generally recommended to choose the local currency to avoid high conversion rates and additional fees associated with Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) (usually 4% or more in Hong Kong) . Paying in the local currency typically results in a better exchange rate provided by your credit card company. Additionally, opt for travel-oriented credit cards that waive foreign purchase fees or offer no foreign transaction fees to save money on international transactions.\nDo cardholders get the exchange rate on the day of spending?\nNo. It will only become visible when the transaction is actually posted, which usually takes a few days.\nWhat do cardholders need to pay attention to on overseas spending?\nIt is important to bear in mind transaction fees should not be the sole factor when deciding which card to use for foreign transaction. You should also consider other factors such as exchange rate and card rebate, etc.\nHomeCredit CardsOverseas Spending\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
