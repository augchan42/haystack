Some even provide coverage against frozen food and beverage protection or outside door locks, window, etc.\nLandlord Insurance VS Renters Insurance\nLandlord Insurance\nIt is important for a landlord to purchase fire insurance, home insurance and third-party liability insurance to protect his or her assets, from building structure, home contents to potential liability to third party due to accidents.

However, some home insurance provides third party liability insurance which may protect policyholders against any injury/ damage caused by the renovation work.\nBurst Pipe Insurance\nWater damage is usually covered as a standard feature in general home insurance, providing protection to your home contents such as furniture and personal belongings. If your home becomes unfit to live in temporarily, you may also get reimbursement on the expenses for alternative accommodation.\nHome Burglary Insurance\nLoss of household property is covered due to burglary in a general home insurance policy.
