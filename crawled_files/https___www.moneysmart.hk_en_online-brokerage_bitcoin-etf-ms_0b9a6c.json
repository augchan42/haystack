A Bitcoin ETF does not represent BTC ownership but it still offers exposure to its value. If you do not prefer actively managing your investment, but at the same time you would like to diversify your investment portfolio, Bitcoin ETF suits you better than directly buying Bitcoin. \n\nBitcoin ETF allows investors, especially beginners, to invest in Bitcoin without the need to go through the hassle of setting up a cryptocurrency exchange account while providing leverage to its value. If Bitcoin increases in price, so does the Bitcoin ETF, and vice versa.\n\nAnother consideration is that a Bitcoin ETF investor doesn\u2019t need to take on the risks of owning Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin itself can be tricky to store and secure. For example, If a Bitcoin investor loses the password to the cryptocurrency wallet, their Bitcoin is lost forever. A Bitcoin ETF investor needs not to bear such risks. However, Bitcoin ETFs charge management fees for the convenience they provide.\nBest Brokerage for buying Bitcoin ETF\nCharles Schwab\nUS$0 US$0\nWebull\nUS$0 US$0\nFutu\nUS$0.99 US$0\nHuatai International\nUS$1 US$0\nThings You Need to Know Before Investing in Bitcoin ETF\nRisks involved in investing Bitcoin ETF\nIf you think that investing in a Bitcoin ETF is free of risk, then you need to think again. There are still risks involved in investing in any investment products with no exception in Bitcoin ETF. Just because it is an ETF doesn't mean that it is necessarily safer or guarantee returns. Although it isn't a direct investment in Bitcoin, it is still risky due to the exposure to Bitcoin.\nNo actual Bitcoin ownership\nBitcoin ETFs attempt to track the performance of Bitcoin. You are not actually buying the underlying investment Bitcoin directly. While Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, they can also have multiple holdings in order to diversify the investment portfolio, suggesting that a rise in the price of Bitcoin may not be accurately reflected in the price of Bitcoin ETF.\nChoosing a licensed exchange\nBefore finding the right online brokerage for investing Bitcoin ETF, you should always check that the online trading platform is licensed and registered by the Securities and Futures Commission. If the online broker is located outside of Hong Kong, you should check if they are licensed in jurisdictions.\nFAQ\nDo I need a US stock account in order to invest in BITO?\nYes, you need to set up an investment account which trading US stocks is available.\nDoes Bitcoin ETF provide leverage to the price of Bitcoin?\nYes, if Bitcoin increases in price, so does the Bitcoin ETF, and vice versa. However, as Bitcoin ETFs have multiple holdings in order to diversify the portfolio, implying that a rise in the price of Bitcoin may not be proportional to that of Bitcoin ETF.\nIs there any other ETF that tracks other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin?\nTo date, most ETFs track Bitcoin and the popular ones are as follows:\nSimplify U.S. Equity PLUS GBTC ETF (SPBC)\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)\nGlobal X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS)\nValkyrie Balance Sheet Opportunities ETF (VBB)\nHomeOnline Brokerage Bitcoin ETFs: What is Bitcoin ETF?
