After applying for credit cards, you need to fulfill the spending requirements to get welcome offers. Take HSBC Red Card as an example, you\u2019ll need to spend $6,000+ in the first 60 days of card issuance, and use RewardCash to pay for credit card statement or transaction via the \u201cPay with RC\u201d function in Reward+ to get $1,000 RewardCash welcome offer. Credit cards set limits to not only spending amounts but also spending categories. For example, HSBC credit cards don\u2019t count online bill payments and e-wallet transactions as eligible spending. Make sure you\u2019ve read the Terms and Conditions before swiping your credit cards! But there are some credit cards that give you welcome gifts once your application is approved. Standard Chartered Simply Cash Visa Card gives you 25% cashback for local spending in the first 2 months and up to $1,000 cashback without spending requirements.\nAre welcome offers for new customers only?\nGenerally, yes. Most of the credit cards only prepare welcome offers for new customers, which means that you haven\u2019t held or cancelled credit cards of your designated bank in the past 6-12 months. But some credit cards still give welcome offers to existing customers, but the value of the offer is lower than the new customers. HSBC Visa Signature Card is a good example: they offer up to $800 welcome gifts to new customers, but $400 welcome gifts for existing customers.\nIs there anything I need to know while applying for welcome offer credit cards?\nAfter getting your welcome offer, most of the banks reserve the right to charge you a handling fee and take back your welcome offer without any notice if you cancel their credit cards in 12 months of card issuance.\nWhen will I receive my welcome offer?\nIf you fulfil the spending requirement, like BOC credit cards, they\u2019ll credit the welcome offer directly to your credit card account in 4 to 6 weeks. But make sure your account is working, valid and under a good credit. For other banks, they have their own policies so it\u2019s better for you to check the Terms and Conditions.\nDo I need to consider anything else apart from welcome offers?\nYes! Welcome offers are attractive, but it\u2019s still a one-time reward. The basic rebate rate after the introductory period should be one of your considerations. Besides that, you should find out your spending pattern. Say, dining is your main expenses, then you should pick a credit card with the most dining offers. Plus, get to know why you\u2019re applying for a credit card, then pinpoint your expenses to get the most offers like cash back and air miles.\nCan I cancel my credit card after receiving the welcome offers?\nIt varies from card to card. In general, if a cardholder cancels the card in less than 12 months from the date the card is issued, a fee which is equivalent to the value of the welcome offers/ administration fee will be charged.\nHomeCredit CardsWelcome Offers\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
