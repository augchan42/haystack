Our furry friends cannot talk in human language thereby we pay additional attention to their every whim and change in behaviour as we want to make sure that they are happy and healthy. However a survey* revealed that 95% of pet owners have not purchased pet insurance, mainly due to their lack of knowledge of this type of insurance and financial concern. While veterinary consultation and medication are usually required even for minor illnesses and injuries, nearly 30% of respondents consider outpatient coverage as the most important benefit item.\nBlue Cross understands pet owner\u2019s needs.
