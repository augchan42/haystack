It utilizes algorithms to analyze big data such as a client's investment goals and risk factors from cautious to adventurous in order to create investment objectives and provide long-term portfolio management.\n\nRobo-advisors operate without much human intervention and will automatically build, manage, and optimize your assets based on the market condition. In addition to lowering costs and manpower involved compared to traditional advisors, investment decisions made by robo-advisors are more objective and rational.\nBest Robo Advisors\nSyfe\nHK$10,000\nNo minimum balance, no lock-in & low fees\nHuatai International Securities\nUS$50\nProvide personalized investment portfolios through Robo-advisory service\nSoFi Hong Kong\nHK$100\nStart investing with as little as US$10 to own fractions of stocks and access robo advisory\nWeLab GoWealth\nHK$100\nLow investment barrier, with no lock-up period\nBenefits of Intelligent Investing\n24/7 Service\nUnlike traditional investment advisors who provide one-on-one service with limited operating hours, Robo Advisors offer round-the-clock service to multiple clients simultaneously, so investors can access the service anytime, allowing them to respond to market trends and adjust their investment portfolios in real-time.\nLower Cost\nRobo Advisors generally have lower fees compared to traditional investment advisors. With reduced operational costs, fees are more affordable, and the investment threshold can be as low as HK$1,000 with fees below 1%, although investment thresholds and fees vary depending on the service provider.\nTime Saving\nIt takes much time and effort for investment advisors to predict the stock market. Robo advisors can achieve this quickly utilizing big data, helping investors formulate and optimize investment portfolios in order to build wealth.\nRational Investment Decisions\nPersonal investments can be influenced by individual biases, and investors may make erroneous judgments driven by emotions. In contrast, Robo Advisors make investment decisions and recommendations based on data analysis and investment analysis profiles, affected by personal emotions or market sentiment, resulting in more rational investment decisions.\nDiversification of Investment Risks\nRobo Advisors cover a range of asset classes with varying risk levels.
