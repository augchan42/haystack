This should support asset valuations but lower cash returns. It\u2019s therefore sensible to put cash to work in quality assets. We prefer US and Asia ex-Japan stocks, and major DM government bonds (7-10 years) and IG credit (5-7 years).\nChina\u2019s Politburo meeting indicated a pro-growth stance with a strategic focus on technology and innovation, industrial upgrading and green transformation. We expect to see proactive fiscal and monetary measures that will deliver solid GDP growth of 4.9% in 2024. While remaining neutral on Chinese equities, we see select opportunities in the consumption, internet and EV sectors.\nAlthough 2024 is expected to be a complex year for investors, we have identified four investment themes to capture opportunities while managing market uncertainties: 1) Optimise bond returns with quality and duration; 2) Focus on large-cap stocks with attractive earnings potential; 3) Exploit opportunities from a broad range of sectors; and 4) Integrate sustainability to capture green potential.
