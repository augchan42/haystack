In most cases, credit cards with a higher annual fee provide more benefits.\nOther Ways to Waive the Annual Fee\nMeet the minimum spend requirement\nSome credit cards will only waive annual fees if a minimum spending requirement is met. If it is not specified, cardholders can usually get it waived as long as there has been a transaction.\nCall customer hotline\nCardholders can call credit card issuers at the 11th month after card issuance to request an annual fee waiver. You can also call after you have been charged. This can usually be done over the automated service over the phone 24 hours a day.\nBecome designated customers\nSome banks offer an annual fee waiver for designated members. For example, American Express Cathay Pacific Elite Credit Card offers an annual fee waiver for Marco Polo Club members.\nRedeem points for an annual fee waiver\nCardholders can also redeem points earned for the annual fee waiver. But before you do this, it is better to call the customer service hotline to check if you can get it waived first.\nCredit Cards with Annual Fee that Cannot Be Waived\nSome premium credit cards which include Citi Prestige Credit Card and The Platinum Card do not accept annual fee waiver requests. These types of credit cards are characterized by exclusive offers. Citi Prestige charges HK$3,800 annual fee. Cardholders can enjoy complimentary global airport lounge access and complimentary 4th night at any hotel. The nonwaivable annual fee of the Platinum Card is HK$7,800. Cardholders can enjoy 1,200+ lounges access all over the world and exclusive access to the Centurion Lounges and complimentary travel insurance, etc.\nFAQ\nWhat is the HSBC customer service hotline for credit card annual fee waiver?\nYou can call HSBC Credit Card Customer Service Hotline at +852 2233 3000 to try getting your credit card annual fee waived.\nHow to waive DBS credit card annual fee?\nYou can call DBS Credit Card Customer Service Hotline at +852 2290 8345 to request an annual fee waiver.\nWhat should applicants be aware of when applying for credit cards with perpetual annual fee waivers?\nApplicant should check if the annual fee waivers apply to all applicants and whether it is applicable to both principal and supplementary cardholders. For example, Standard Chartered Simply Cash only offers a perpetual annual fee waiver to holders of priority banking/premium banking/bonus payroll. Moreover, it is only exclusive for principal cardholders. In other words, if you would like to apply for a supplementary card, you will need to pay for the annual fee for the extra card.\nDo I have to pay an annual fee even if I don\u2019t use the credit card anymore?\nYes, the annual fee will be charged regardless of the credit card activity, but you may ask the credit card issuer to see if you can apply for a credit card annual fee waiver, or you may also consider cancelling your credit card if you no longer use its benefits.\nWhat is the definition of a new customer when applying credit cards?\nMost of the credit cards only offer an annual fee waiver to new customers, but different banks have their own definition for a new customer. Take Citibank as an example, customers who currently do not hold, have not cancelled or have not held any principal card of Citi Credit Card within the past 12 months will be considered as a new customer, but for Standard Chartered, applicants who do not currently hold and have not cancelled any principal card of Standard Chartered credit card in the past 6 months will be eligible to get the new customer offer.\nHomeCredit CardsAnnual Fee Waiver\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
