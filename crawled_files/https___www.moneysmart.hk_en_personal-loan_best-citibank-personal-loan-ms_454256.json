Make sure you read the fine print and understand the loan structure. Once selected, fill in the application form and submit all the required documents.\nWait for Your Loan Approval Result\nCitibank Loan Specialist will then contact you within 1-2 working days to finalize the terms of the loan. If the loan is eventually approved, you will be required to visit a designated branch to go through the loan disbursement process.\nDisbursement of Your Loan\nIf you are applying for Card Debt Consolidation Loans, you will be required to sign the drawdown letter so that Citibank can settle your card debt with other financial institutions. For other loan types, your loan will be disbursed instantly via cash, cheque or credit into your designated bank account\nCitibank Loan Offers & Promotions\nLike every other bank or money lender, Citibank sometimes offers seasonal promotions for their personal loan products, such as low APR rates, cash coupons, even gifts such as tablets. These sweeteners are no doubt appealing, but as a consumer, you should protect yourself by paying special attention to the fine print of these offers. Loan promotions that advertise low APR rates tend to be limited to specific loan amounts and repayment periods, and they may be modelled based on a different interest rate structure than what you're actually getting. Check that the promotional loan repayment structure is something you would be comfortable committing to first. Welcome gifts such as cash coupons are sometimes given with no strings attached, but in other cases, banks are able to \"claw back\" the gift if you do not fulfil certain requirements set out in the terms & conditions. Warning: You have to repay your loans. Don't pay any intermediaries.\nCitibank Loan Application Supporting Documents\nIn addition to the eligibility criteria defined above, you're required to submit the following important documents before Citibank can approve your loan:\nProof of income\nCitibank accepts several documents to prove your income. It's best to furnish official payroll slips (complete with company stamp/letterhead), but if this is not available, you can also submit your bank statement or account passbook showing your salary deposit record for at least the past three months.\nResidential proof\nThis is any official letter or bill that proves that you are a real resident of the address you provided. It must clearly state both your name and residential address. You may submit your utility bill, mobile phone bill, bank statement, or letter from the government.\nCitibank Loan Fees & Charges\nAPR (interest rate) may be the most prominent cost component of your personal loan, but it is by no means the only one! You should also be aware of the following fees that Citibank may charge in various scenarios.\nHandling Fee\nCitibank advertises a 0% handling fee for their personal loans, but it is possible that this fee is simply absorbed into the APR. Do compare personal loans across banks to make sure you have the best rate.\nEarly Repayment Fee\nKudos to you for clearing your personal loan early, but there will be a fee for doing so. This is typically 1.5% of the principal loan amount but it varies a little depending on when exactly you make early repayment.\nChange of Repayment Date\nIt is possible to extend your repayment date, but you will be charged a Daily Extension Fee at the same interest rate of your personal loan. The maximum extension Citibank will grant you is 45 days.\nCitibank Loan Customer Service Hotline\nNeed to speak to someone at Citibank urgently regarding your loan? For loan-related inquiries and to follow up on your loan application, you can call Citibank's hotline at (852) 2963 6477. The hotline operates from Mondays to Fridays from 9am to 8pm, and on Saturdays from 9am to 6pm.\nPersonal Loan Hong Kong Reviews\nSCB Personal Loans\nHSBC Personal Loans\nDBS Personal Loans\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow is interest rate calculated for Citibank personal loans?\nTake note that Citibank's advertised interest rate may not be exactly the same as the actual APR you are charged. This is because Citibank can choose to charge a higher or lower rate depending on the loan applicant's background and work status.\nHow long does Citibank take to approve a loan?\nFor Citibank Speedy Cash, it is possible to get same-day approval, provided you successfully submit all required documents together with a complete application form before noon on a working day. With other Citibank loan types, it may take longer for the bank to verify all your documents.\nCan I get a loan for my Citibank credit card?\nIf you're facing trouble paying off a Citibank credit card, Citibank also has loan services specific to their cards. For example, certain cards are eligible for a flexi-instalment programme, which allows you to repay your credit card balance in manageable instalments.\nDoes Citibank have an automatic repayment function for their personal loans?\nYes, a good way to avoid being hit by late repayment fees and the like is to set up an AutoPay instruction to settle your monthly instalments. Citibank's All-In-One AutoPay can be used to repay loans (as well as other recurring charges like utility and phone bills). The monthly repayments are automatically debited from your bank account whenever they are due.\nHomePersonal LoanBest Citibank Personal Loan Hong Kong 2022\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
