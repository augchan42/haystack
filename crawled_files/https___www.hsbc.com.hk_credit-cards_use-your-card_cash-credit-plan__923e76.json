The personalised preferential annual interest rate of 5.8% is applicable to selected customers and is for reference only. The preferential annual interest rate is to be determined by HSBC from time to time for individual promotion. The preferential annual interest rate and annualised percentage rate ('APR') differ depending on individual customer eligibility. Please call our hotline for the preferential annual interest rate and the annualised percentage rate applicable to you. The APR for the preferential annual interest rate 5.8% is 5.96%. The annualised percentage rate ('APR') is calculated using the method specified in relevant guidelines issued by The Hong Kong Association of Banks, and is rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places.
