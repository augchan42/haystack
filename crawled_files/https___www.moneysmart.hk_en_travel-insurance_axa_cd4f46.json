While almost all travel insurance offers medical protection, AXA Travel Insurance has more extensive coverage, covering your medical expenses during and after the trip from guaranteed hospital admittance deposit to local translation services costs and follow-up medical expenses after returning to Hong Kong. The medical protection also covers alternative treatments such as Chinese bone-setting, acupuncture, physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment for you to choose the most suitable medical care you need. AXA Travel Insurance also provides emergency medical evacuation, compassionate visits and return of unattended dependent children.\nSingle Journey VS Annual Cover\nSingle Journey Cover is designed for travellers who only travel occasionally while Annual Cover is tailored for frequent travellers. If you compare the cost of annual & single travel insurance plans, you will find that the cost of the former is on average almost 6 times more than the cost of the latter. In other words, unless you are a frequent traveller that will travel up to or more than 6 times a year, it is probably cheaper to buy single travel insurance. If you opt for single travel insurance for multiple trips a year, you will need to purchase single travel insurance every time when you go on holiday. If you choose the annual cover, it also saves you the hassle from buying travel insurance every time you travel.\nAXA Travel Insurance Coverage\nNo matter if you book a tour or travel on your own, you will also need to compare the coverage of different types of policy and pick the one that suits you and your family the most.\nFor single-journey travel insurance, your unmarried child/ children aged 30 days or more and under 18 years old can enjoy free cover if the details of the children are provided in the application form.\nIt is worth noting that the age limit applies to travel insurance. For a single journey policy, the insured person must be 30 days old or above. The maximum limit for the annual cover is 75 years old. This policy provides cover for lost or damaged personal belongings including computer and camera (applicable to Superior and Economy Plan) but mobile phones and tablets are not covered.\nAXA travel insurance claim\nYou can easily submit your AXA travel insurance claims online! Just download the AXA travel insurance claim form, fill in the details of your claims, submit it with relevant documents and your claim will be processed within 7 working days.\nAXA Travel Insurance Optional Covers\nFor single trip travel insurance, your children are eligible for free cover. You can also upgrade the plan to enjoy enhanced children's cover to 100% medical expenses coverage and 50% accidental death coverage. You can pay for the optional coverage for the guarantee of hospital deposit to the hospital under Hospital Network in China if you present the China Hospital Deposit Guarantee Card.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDoes AXA Travel Insurance offer Covid-19 Coverage?\nYes, AXA Travel Insurance offers coverage for Covid-19.\nIf my phone is lost while I\u2019m on holiday, will AXA SmartTraveller Plus cover my loss?\nNo. Although this policy provides cover for lost or damaged personal belongings(applicable to Superior and Economy Plan), mobile phones and tablets are not covered.\nHow far in advance can I buy travel insurance?\nYou can purchase SmartTraveller Plus 90 days before your trip departure date.
