So, Annual Percentage Rate (APR) expressed as a percentage of the actual yearly cost of a loan over the term. It is the best indicator when doing the comparison of different loan plans.\nAre Tax loans only for tax payment?\nTax loans are not only for tax payment. It can be used for funds for your other plans, such as a home renovation, marriage, further education or additional cash flow.\nTips for Getting Tax Loans and Comparing Tax Loans\nTip #1\nAnnual Percentage Rate (APR) is the key to compare loans\nThe calculation of APR includes all the interests, admin fees and handling fees of a tax loan. That\u2019s why APR is the best way to compare the actual expenses of tax loans.\nTip #2\nDifferent loan promotions launch in tax seasons\nBanks and private lenders usually launch tax loan offers from October to April of the next year. Out of all loan promotions, cash rebate is the most common one \u2013 the more you borrow, the more rebates you can get.\nTip #3\nBe aware of the terms and conditions in loans\nSome tax loans may look attractive with an extremely low interest rate. But everything come at a price \u2014 the banks will ask you to set up an account and make a huge deposit first; or they\u2019ll set a bottom limit to your borrowing amount, then you\u2019ll have to borrow a loan of $1,000,000+ to get the lowest interest rate.\nHow can I apply for Tax Loan?
