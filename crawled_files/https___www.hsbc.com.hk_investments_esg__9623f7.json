Certain instruments HSBC (\u201cwe\u201d) classify as sustainable may be in the process of changing to deliver sustainability outcomes. There is no guarantee that ESG and Sustainable investing products will produce returns similar to those which don\u2019t consider these factors. ESG and Sustainable investing products may diverge from traditional market benchmarks. In addition, there is no standard definition of, or measurement criteria for, ESG and Sustainable investing or the impact of ESG and Sustainable investing products. ESG and Sustainable investing and related impact measurement criteria are (a) highly subjective and (b) may vary significantly across and within sectors.\nHSBC may rely on measurement criteria devised and reported by third party providers or issuers. HSBC does not always conduct its own specific due diligence in relation to measurement criteria. There is no guarantee: (a) that the nature of the ESG / sustainability impact or measurement criteria of an investment will be aligned with any particular investor\u2019s sustainability goals; or (b) that the stated level or target level of ESG / sustainability impact will be achieved. ESG and Sustainable investing is an evolving area and new regulations are being developed which will affect how investments can be categorised or labelled. An investment which is considered to fulfil sustainable criteria today may not meet those criteria at some point in the future.\nWhen we classify an investment product or service against our ESG and Sustainable Investing (SI) categories described in this document: ESG Enhanced, Thematic or Impact, this does not mean that all individual underlying holdings in the investment product or portfolio will meet the relevant SI criteria. As such, an SI classification does not mean that all underlying holdings in a fund or discretionary portfolio meet the relevant sustainable investment criteria. Similarly, where an equity or fixed income investment is classified under an ESG Enhanced, Thematic or Impact category this does not mean that the underlying issuer\u2019s activities are fully sustainable. Not all investments, portfolios or services are classifiable under our SI categories. This may be because there is insufficient information available or because a particular investment product does not meet HSBC\u2019s SI classifications criteria.\nGreen, Social and Sustainability Bonds risk disclosure\nGreen, Social and Sustainability (GSS) Bond labelling is a voluntary and recommended process and framework established by ICMA, the International Capital Markets Association. It aims to promote the integrity of the green, social and sustainability bond market. The intention is to encourage transparency and disclose on the specific use of proceeds to show investors the environmental and/or social projects financed by the financial instrument. The ICMA framework recommends a specific approved list of use of proceeds, a process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and annual reporting on use of proceeds.\nAlthough the use of proceeds for a GSS bond can be verified by a second party opinion, third party verification or other equivalent process, the Bank cannot guarantee the issuer will indeed manage the use of proceeds to fund green or social projects throughout the life of the outstanding bond as there is no legal way to enforce the declared use of proceeds.\n  Sustainability-linked bonds:\nSustainability-linked bonds are any type of bond instrument for which the financial and/or structural characteristics can vary depending on whether the issue achieves predefined sustainability/ESG objectives. sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) labelling is a voluntary and recommended process and framework established by ICMA, the International Capital Markets Association. The objectives are (i) measured through predefined key performance indicators (KPIs) and (ii) assessed against predefined sustainability performance targets (SPTs). There is no guarantee SLBs will deliver on their sustainability performance targets and the proceeds of the instrument are not tied to specific environmental and/or social projects.\nAlthough the progress made against the KPIs and SPTs can be verified by a second party opinion, third party verification or other equivalent process, the Bank cannot guarantee the issuer of the financial instrument is making progress against those sustainability/ESG objectives.\n  Risk disclosure \u2013 Bonds and certificates of deposit (\"CDs\")\nThere are risks involved in buying bonds / CDs. Before applying for any of bonds / CDs, you should consider whether bonds / CDs is suitable for you in light of your own financial circumstances and objectives. If you are in any doubt, get independent professional advice.\nBonds / CDs are mainly medium to long term fixed income products, not for short term speculation. You should be prepared to hold your funds in bonds / CDs for the full tenor; you could lose part or all of your principal if you choose to sell your bonds / CDs prior to maturity.\nIt is the issuer to pay interest and repay principal of bonds / CDs. If the issuer defaults, the holder of bonds / CDs may not be able to receive back the interest and principal. The holder of bonds / CDs bears the credit risk of the issuer and has no recourse to HSBC unless HSBC is the issuer itself.\nIndicative price of bonds / CDs are available and the bonds / CDs' prices do fluctuate when market changes. Factors affecting market price of bonds / CDs include, and are not limited to, fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, and liquidity premiums. The fluctuation in yield generally has a greater effect on prices of longer tenor bonds / CDs. There is an inherent risk that losses may be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling bonds / CDs.\nIf you wish to sell bonds / CDs, HSBC may repurchase them based on the prevailing market price under normal market circumstances, but the selling price may differ from the original buying price due to changes in market conditions.\nThere may be exchange rate risks if you choose to convert payments made on the bond/CDs to your home currency.\nThe secondary market for bonds / CDs may not provide significant liquidity or may trade at prices based on the prevailing market conditions and may not be in line with the expectations of bonds / CDs' holders.\nIf bonds / CDs are early redeemed, you may not be able to enjoy the same rates of return when you use the funds to purchase other products.\nDo not purchase the bonds / CDs unless you fully understand and are willing to assume the risks associated with it.\n  High yield bonds risk disclosure\nHigh yield bonds are typically rated below investment grade by a credit rating agency, or unrated. Whilst high yield bonds bear a higher yield opportunity than investment grade bonds, they present greater risks of issuer default, liquidity, volatility and non-payment of principal and interest.\nThe risk of default on principal and / or interest, is greater for high yield bonds due to higher credit risk of the issuer and lower priority of claim by the bond holders in case of issuer default.\nHigh yield bonds can sometimes be less liquid than investment-grade bonds, depending on the issuer and the market conditions at any given time. Investors may be difficult to sell the high yield bond before maturity or at prices in line with their expectation compare to listed bond.\nHigh yield bonds tend to be more vulnerable to economic cycles and changes in the issuer's financial conditions or business developments. In particular, during economic downturn, such bonds typically fall more in value than investment-grade bonds as the issuer default risk rises and investors become more risk adverse.\nPlease be aware the concentration risk of investing in bonds issued by the same issuer or companies by the same group. A degrading of any of the group company's credit rating may expose the whole group to contagion risk. Please be also aware the risk of over concentrating investment in the high risk investment products.\n  Risk disclosure \u2013 structured products\n\nEquity-linked investments (\"ELIs\") risk dislosure\nThe following risks should be read together with the other risks contained in the \"Risk Warnings\" section in the relevant offering documents of the ELIs.\nYou should note that the information contained in this material does NOT form part of the offering documents of our ELIs.
