Boost your credit score in just one step! Selected customers can receive up to HK$16,000 Cash Rebate upon successful draw down! \nValid until 31 Jan 2024\nLike many banks and lending companies, one of WeLend's offerings is a Card Debt Consolidation Loan, a special type of personal loan where WeLend clears multiple credit card debts in one shot, freeing you up to repay WeLend according to your preferred schedule. Not only does this improve your cash flow, it also helps your credit score and saves on the high interest you would otherwise pay on your credit card bills.\nWhen you submit your loan application online, WeLend uses what they call an A.I. Card Debt Master to assess your credit profile automatically and calculate three repayment plans tailored to your profile. Each of the three options is optimized to reduce the interest paid, reduce the monthly installment amounts, or reduce the time taken to repay the loan.\nThose who meet WeLend's credit requirements may also opt for a \"phased\" debt consolidation plan, which clears upcoming debts as well as current outstanding ones.\nEligibility requirements for this loan are the same: You must be a Hong Kong resident, at least 18 years old, employed at your current job for at least two months, and earning at least HK$8,000 a month.\nNote: The final loan amount approved by WeLend and the loan tenure is evaluated on a case by case basis.

Make sure you read the fine print and understand the loan structure. Once selected, fill in the application form and submit all the required documents. You can do this online in a matter of minutes.\nWait for Your Loan Approval Result\nWeLend has a two-step approval system. First, you will get preliminary approval by SMS and email within one working day of your online application. Once you get that, you can proceed to submit your supporting documents. A WeLend Loan Specialist will then contact you for verification and to confirm the loan agreement.\nDisbursement of Your Loan\nFor WeLend personal loans, if the verification and loan agreement process is done before 1.30pm, the funds will be transferred to your disbursement account on the same day. For debt consolidation loans, WeLend will also transfer the outstanding amounts to the financial institutions on the same day.\nWeLend Loan Application Supporting Documents\nHere's a quick primer on how and what to submit to WeLend when applying for a personal loan from them.\nWhat to submit\nThere are four supporting documents you have to submit to WeLend after obtaining your preliminary loan approval. (1) A copy of your HKID. (2) Proof of your disbursement account. (3) Residential proof, e.g. an official letter or bill stating both your name and address. (4) Payslips or other proof of income (1 month for fixed salary earners, 3 months for commission-based earners, and 6 months for real estate workers). If you are applying for the WeLend No Document Loan, you only need to submit (1) and (2).\nHow to submit\nThe best way to submit your documents is through the WeLend website. You will get an account after submitting an online application; log in to your account and you will be able to upload the documents from your computer or mobile phone. Otherwise, you can also send the documents to WeLend via email (doc@welend.hk), WhatsApp (5633-5939), LINE (Welend.hk) or fax Fax\uff1a3590-3991\nWeLend Loan Fees & Charges\nOne of WeLend's key selling points is that there are no hidden charges and fees. There is a handling fee for each loan, but this is incorporated into the APR when they calculate your loan interest rate. However, if you miss the deadline for a payment, WeLend will change a HK$350 \"service fee\" per late repayment. You will be notified by email, and there are no further penalties for late payment. It is also possible to settle your WeLend loan ahead of schedule without paying any early settlement fees. You just need to inform WeLend at least 30 days in advance by WhatsApp (5633-5939) or email (cs@welend.hk).\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow much can I borrow from WeLend?\nHow much money you can borrow depends on your personal background, including your credit score, monthly income, occupation, and financial situation.
