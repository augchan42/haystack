According to the statistics of the Department of Health in 2019, cancer, pneumonia and heart disease are the top three killing diseases in Hong Kong which account for approximately 62% of all deaths. You are recommended to perform annual medical check-up to better understand your health condition and be prepared for any treatments or take preventive measures\n4 plans of Preventive Checkup Programme:\nBasic Health Plan\nStandard Health Plan\nComprehensive Health Plan\nExecutive Health Plan\nImmunisation Programme\nHepatitis A and Hepatitis B are common diseases in Hong Kong. Hepatitis A is transmitted faeco-orally via contaminated food especially seafood like oyster, mussel, bivalves or drinking water. Information from the Center for Health Protection shows that Hepatitis A infection is rarely fatal and does not cause chronic liver disease. However, it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality. According to the statistics from the Department of Health, Hepatitis B is not uncommon in Hong Kong. About 8% of the population are carriers of the virus. Through the Hepatitis B vaccination, you can prevent the infection and its consequences like liver cirrhosis and cancer.
