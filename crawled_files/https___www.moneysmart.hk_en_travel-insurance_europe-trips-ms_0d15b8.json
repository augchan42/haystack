The areas that you should be focusing on when taking out travel insurance are medical coverage, personal accidents and emergency assistance. In terms of medical coverage, the insured should pay attention to the coverage of overseas medical coverage and outpatient follow-up upon returning to Hong Kong.\n\nFor personal accidents, you will be compensated depending on the severity of your injury. Emergency assistance covers repatriation after treatment, compassionate visit, repatriation of mortal remains, advance payment of hospital deposits, etc.\nTerrorism Insurance\nIt is not uncommon for travel providers to exclude terrorism in the travel insurance, meaning that no compensation will be provided as a result of terrorism. So it\u2019s worth checking before taking out your travel insurance. If you want to be sure, you can also call the insurance provider to confirm.\nTravel Insurance Covers Theft\nMost travel insurance covers monetary loss as a result of unauthorized use of credit cards, and travelers\u2019 cheques. Some come with excess - meaning that the insured is required to pay a certain amount of money before making a claim. Please note that in case of theft or robbery, you are required to report the incident to the police within 24 hours and provide the relevant report to the insurance provider in order to make a claim. \n\n\nBest Europe Travel insurance FAQ\nCan someone under 18 years old take out travel insurance plans?\nYes, although not all providers accept it, but some do, such as STARR Companies TraveLead Supreme Plan.
