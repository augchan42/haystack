Do I still need to get home contents insurance such as AXA SmartHome Plus?\nYes.

AXA SmartHome Plus provides a different sum insured according to the different size of the property. You can also add additional benefits and top-ups such as the option to cover your personal belongings worldwide based on your needs.\nDoes SmartHome Plus cover the valuables at home?\nYes. SmartHome Plus cover accidental loss or damage of the valuables at your home, capped at HK$ 10,000 per item (for Plan B) and HK$ 600,000 or 1/3 of the home contents sum insured (whichever is lesser) in a year. For personal belongings worth over HK$10,000, the insured can also contact AXA to apply for additional coverage of specified valuables.\nWhat coverage can I get in case of typhoon or black rainstorm?\nIf water or electricity supply or all the elevators' service is suspended due to typhoon signal no.8 or above, or black rainstorm for over 6 hours, AXA will reimburse your actual expenses on temporary accommodation and meal up to 5 days, capped at HK$ 1,500 per day, and HK$90,000 during the period of insurance.\nHomeHome InsuranceAXA\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Financial (\u201cMSHKF\u201d) is a Hong Kong established insurance broker licensed by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (license no.
