American Express is slightly less widely accepted than the other two but is still valid at many major hotels, department stores, and restaurants. Amex also issues credit cards directly (rather than through banks), so it may offer more attractive perks and better customer service.\nCan I transfer American Express rewards points to Cathay Pacific Asia Miles?\nYes, you can convert Amex Membership Rewards points into miles with any of Amex\u2019s partner frequent flyer programs, including Cathay Pacific Asia Miles. Every 15,000 points can be changed to 1,000 Asia Miles, which can then be used to redeem Cathay Pacific flights.\nHow do I activate my American Express credit card?\nEasy: Just call the number on the back of the credit card. Alternatively, you can activate your credit card online. We recommend registering for American Express online services as well, so you can receive credit card e-statements, pay bills online, and manage your rewards points easily.\nHow do I get an American Express annual fee waiver?\nSeveral American Express credit cards offer a first-year annual fee waiver. Subsequently, you may be able to get your annual fee waived if you meet specific spending requirements. For example, American Express Cathay Pacific credit card holders get a fee waiver by spending HK$100,000 in a year.\nIs it Difficult to Get an AE Credit Card?\nYou might have heard that American Express credit cards are for high net worth individuals and are therefore out of reach for most regular people in Hong Kong. This is true for certain American Express cards such as The Platinum Card, which has a very high annual income requirement of HK$1,000,000. If you\u2019re not a millionaire, however, there are still quite a few American Express credit cards to choose from. In fact, the annual income requirements can be as low as HK$150,000, making Amex cards suitable even as entry-level credit cards.\nHomeCredit CardsAmerican Express\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
