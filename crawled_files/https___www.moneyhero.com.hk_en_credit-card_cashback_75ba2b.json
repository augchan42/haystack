You may benefit more with certain credit cards for daily shopping, other cards may reward you more for eating out or spending overseas when travelling. Depending on your spending habits, some cards may be better than others. Discover which cash back credit card is best for you and maximise your rewards!\nCredit cards with the highest cash back for supermarket spending\nCredit cards that focus on supermarket spending rewards may help you earn additional money back on your grocery shopping. For example, Mox Credit can earn 3% unlimited cash back at major supermarkets in Hong Kong like HKTVmall, PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, and City'super. The Standard Chartered Smart Card can earn 5% cash back on designated shops such as HKTVmall and PARKnSHOP, while the Hang Seng enJoy Card offers an 8% discount on Wellcome and Market Place by Jasons purchases over HK$100 on the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd of each month.\n\nCredit cards with the highest cash rewards for dining\nDining credit cards provide various benefits and rewards for dining enthusiasts, allowing you to earn cash back or other incentives while enjoying your favourite meals.
