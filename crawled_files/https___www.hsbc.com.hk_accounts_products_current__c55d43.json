In the event that the total amount of all the cheques issued by the same customer in Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) presented on a particular clearing day exceed RMB80,000, one or more of the cheques will be returned in order to keep the total settlement amount of the relevant cheques for the day to be within the limit of RMB80,000. A Return Cheque Fee will be levied. Renminbi cheques can be issued to individuals and companies in Hong Kong with a valid renminbi account which can accept renminbi cheque deposits. Please check that the individual or company is willing to accept renminbi cheques as a means of payment. Renminbi denominated cheques issued by non-Hong Kong residents are for use in Hong Kong only and are not for use in the Mainland.\n  Risk Disclosure\nCurrency conversion risk - the value of your foreign currency and renminbi deposit will be subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. If you choose to convert your renminbi deposit to other currencies at an exchange rate that is less favorable than the exchange rate in which you made your original conversion to renminbi, you may suffer loss in principal. \nInvestment involves risks. Past performance of investment products are no guide to future performance. For details of the investment products and the investment-linked insurance plan, their related fees and charges and risk factors, please refer to the individual product materials/ offering documents.\nBack to top \n\u00a9 Copyright.
