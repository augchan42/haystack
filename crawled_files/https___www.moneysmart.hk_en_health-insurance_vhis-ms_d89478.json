The exact timing of the migration may depend on the renewal cycle of your current insurance policy. You can approach your insurance company or agent/broker for details.\nTax Deduction\nHolder of certified plans can claim up to HK$8,000 tax deduction in each assessment year. If you purchase VHIS policies for your relatives, you can claim tax reduction. Please note that there is no limit on the number of eligible policies that you can claim.\nFactors to consider\nThere are a lot of things to consider when it comes to purchasing insurance.
