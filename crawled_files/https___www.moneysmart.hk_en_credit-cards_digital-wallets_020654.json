You need to top up your PayMe account with a credit card or bank account to pay and you need to have a local bank account to get paid.

The rebate, in general, will be added to your account automatically within the apps. Some digital wallets will provide time-limited welcome offers as well such as AlipayHK and BoC Pay.\nCan I use WeChat Pay or Alipay in China?\nYes, you can. Both WeChat Pay and Alipay provide cross-border payment services, which allow users to pay purchases made in China with HKD.\nCan I transfer money overseas with digital wallets?\nYes. With a specific digital wallet such as TNG wallet, you can transfer money to specific countries such as Singapore, Canada and the UK.\nHow to earn rebates with digital wallets?\nUsers can earn rebates with an eligible credit card. Simply top up your digital wallets such as PayMe with an eligible credit card, then transfer the top-up amount to your bank account. In this way, you can earn rebates at no cost. It\u2019s slightly different for Alipay HK and WeChat Pay. It\u2019s less direct. You have to bind your credit card and transfer funds to a friend of yours first. If he/she does the same, transferring the same amount of funds to you through the digital wallets, then it will cancel out the amount of money that you send to him or her. In this way, you can earn rebates without costing you anything.\nHow can I know if my cards can earn rebates in digital wallets?\nThere is a wide range of credit cards providing rebates for digital wallets but credit card providers can change the terms and conditions at any point so you can also refer to MoneySmart website for the latest information. Depending on whether you would like to earn rebates or collect miles, you can consider using these credit cards with the highest top-up rebate including Citi Cash Back Card, Citi Prestige Card, Dah Sing British Airways Platinum Card and CCB Eye Card.\nWhich Digital Wallet is the best?\nThere is no such thing as the best digital wallet, it all depends on your spending habits and which credit card you own. For example, if you are a frequent traveller to China, Alipay or Wechat Pay offers transaction functions in China with multiple merchant offers and promotions, which will give you more benefits than other digital wallets.\nCan I earn rebates with all of the digital wallets?\nYou can earn air miles or cash rebates by linking credit cards to most of the digital wallets, including Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayMe etc. However, not all digital wallets offer credit card rewards, take TNG wallet as an example, top-up with a credit card will cost you 2.5% of the total top-up amount as an administration fee, with no rebate rewards.\nWhat is the difference between PayMe and FPS?\nPayMe e-wallet is an app launched by HSBC with a daily transfer limit of HK$5,000. It supports instant interbank fund transfer but it takes 2-3 days for transferring the balance of PayMe to HSBC/Hang Seng bank account. FPS is an interbank fund transfer system launched by the HKMA, which is directly linked to a bank account. The daily transfer limit is HK$10,000. It also supports instant interbank fund transfer. Registration through the bank required.\nHomeCredit CardsDigital Wallets\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
