Their rewards programme, called Red Hot Rewards, lets all credit card holders earn rewards points for spending on their cards. You earn $1 RewardCash for every HK$250, RMB250 (on the HSBC UnionPay Dual Currency Cards) or US$30 (on an HSBC USD Visa Gold Card) spent. Subsequently, your RewardCash can be converted into shopping coupons, air miles or cash rebates - your choice.\nAsia Miles & Other Mileage Programmes\nHSBC RewardCash can be exchanged for Asia Miles. You will need to be an Asia Miles member before you enroll in HSBC\u2019s mileage programme online. It costs HK$300 annually (which can be paid for with $300 RewardCash). After you\u2019re enrolled in the programme, you can transfer RewardCash into your Asia Miles account at a conversion rate of $1 RewardCash = 10 Asia Miles.\nRewardCash Certificate Scheme\nIf you\u2019d like to earn shopping vouchers instead, you can enroll in HSBC\u2019s certificate scheme online. This lets you pool all your HSBC credit card spending into one card, letting you accumulate RewardCash more quickly. Every quarter, your RewardCash will be consolidated and converted into a certificate (issued in multiples of $50). You\u2019ll receive the certificate in the mail, and you can then exchange it for cash coupons from AEON, PARKnSHOP, and SOGO.\nHSBC Dining Promotions\nApart from earning HSBC RewardsCash, holding an HSBC credit card also entitles you to dining promotions at popular restaurants and hotel buffets in Hong Kong. Some of the more enticing offers include Bostonian Seafood & Grill, BLT Steak, Gaylord Indian Restaurant, and Big Bay Cafe. Check HSBC\u2019s Red Hot Offers listings for the latest dining promotions.\nHSBC Credit Card Features & Benefits\nApart from the lifestyle benefits illustrated above, HSBC credit cards also come with some features that make it practical for day-to-day usage. Some of the features common across all HSBC credit cards are:\n#1\nOctopus AAVS\nOctopus AAVS (Automatic Add Value Service) allows HSBC credit card holders to automatically reload their Octopus cards in increments of either HK$250 or HK$500. You\u2019ll be billed for Octopus top ups together with your other credit card spending. Best of all, this lets you earn HSBC RewardCash for every Octopus reload.\n#2\nHSBC Reward+ Mobile App\nOpen to all HSBC credit card holders, the HSBC Reward+ mobile app lets you manage your credit card accounts on the go and browse the latest HSBC promotions (Red Hot Offers). You can also use the app to offset your HSBC credit card bills with the RewardCash you\u2019ve earned.\n#3\nMobile Payments\nHSBC credit cards are compatible with the three major mobile digital wallets: Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. You can add your credit card to your mobile phone and make payment both conveniently and securely.\nPaying Bills with HSBC Credit Cards\nHSBC customers can use their credit cards to pay various bills including utilities, telephone and government-specific bills. You can do so easily via HSBC\u2019s EBPP (Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment Service), a one-stop platform that consolidates all your e-bills. Here are some common bills you can pay with HSBC cards:\nUtility Bills\nHSBC credit cards can be used to pay electricity and gas bills from CLP Power, Hong Kong Electric, Hong Kong and China Gas, and the Water Supplies Department.\nPhone & Internet Bills\nHSBC credit cards can also be used to pay your telecommunications bills, such as for monthly postpaid data plans and SIM card recharging, from selected vendors such as CSL, PCCW, and SmarTone.\nGovernment Bill & Tax Payment\nHSBC credit cards are accepted as a payment mode for a range of government-related bills and fines, such as the Inland Revenue Department, Student Finance Office, and Traffic Tickets.\nHSBC Visa Signature vs Platinum Card - which is better?\nHSBC\u2019s two most attractive credit cards for medium-to-high income earners in Hong Kong are the HSBC Visa Signature Card and the HSBC Visa Platinum Card. But what\u2019s the difference and which is better?\nBoth cards are structured similarly in terms of benefits, but the HSBC Visa Signature Card has a higher income requirement (HK$480,000), as well as higher rewards, earn rate (9X RewardCash in the category of your choice).\nThe HSBC Visa Platinum Card, on the other hand, has a much lower income requirement (HK$150,000) but also a lower earn rate for RewardCash (6X in the category of your choice).\nSo if you qualify for it, the HSBC Visa Signature is a much better choice. It also comes with a few extra perks such as free airport lounge access with upon spending HK$1,500, 1-for-1 movie tickets, and a one-time 1-for-1 buffet dinner at Grand Hyatt Hong Kong.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo HSBC credit cards offer annual fee waiver?\nHSBC has two cards with perpetual fee waivers: HSBC Premier Mastercard and HSBC Advance Visa Platinum Card, but they are both for higher income customers. Annual fees apply to other cards, but HSBC may offer annual fee waivers on a case-by-case basis.\nCan I pay my taxes with an HSBC credit card?\nYes, HSBC credit cards have a tax payment feature so you can use it to pay the Inland Revenue Department. HSBC may even offer special promotions for paying taxes with their cards.\nCan I use my HSBC credit card overseas?\nYou can use your HSBC credit card to pay at credit card terminals overseas and as an ATM card to withdraw cash. You typically need to pay HK$20 per transaction if you use your HSBC credit card for an overseas ATM withdrawal.\nWhich is the best HSBC Credit Card?\nHSBC credit cards have a flexible rewards programme where you can choose the spending category (e.g. dining) you\u2019d like to be rewarded for. Generally, the higher the minimum income requirement, the higher the earn rate. So if you qualify for a few cards, pick the one with the highest income requirement. If you frequently shuttle between Hong Kong and China, however, you may want to apply for the HSBC UnionPay Dual Currency Credit Card since it makes paying in RMB cheaper and more convenient.\nHow do I apply for a HSBC credit card?\nYou can apply for an HSBC credit card online or by visiting a HSBC branch. For quicker approval, come prepared with your personal and employment details, as well as supporting documents such as proof of income and employment contract.\nHow do I check my HSBC credit card application status?\nHSBC takes about six working days to process an application, and another three days to send out the new credit card. You can check your application status by calling (852) 2233 3000 and quoting your application reference number. The priority banking hotlines are (852) 2233 3322 for HSBC Premier customers and (852) 2748 8333 for HSBC Advance customers.\nHomeCredit CardsHSBC\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
