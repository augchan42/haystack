You can open an HK Stocks account online without the need to show up in person. It is best suited for short-term and day trading. But it is worth noting that it takes time to transfer funds from your bank account to your trading account to start trading, so you may miss some investment opportunities in the meantime.\nAlso, it takes time to transfer funds from your HK Stocks trading account to your bank account. Admittedly, it is less convenient than banks but it charges a lot less for trading. Buy and hold investors with substantial investment can consider opening stock accounts in banks as they offer some extra credibility. No matter if you open an account with a bank or broker, you are protected under the investors compensation scheme. Under the terms of the Investor Compensation Fund (ICF), an investor is eligible for compensation of up to HK$500,000 should he or she sustain a loss as a result of a default by an intermediary, be it a bank or broker in relation to specified securities and futures contracts, or related assets.\nTrading Hong Kong Stocks\uff1aBanks VS Brokers\nProtection\nup to HK$500,000 (under the terms of the Investor Compensation Fund) up to HK$500,000 (under the terms of the Investor Compensation Fund)\nTransaction Fee\n0.15-0.3% 0.15-0.25%\nCustodian Fee\nHK$0 HK$15-30/ month\nHK Stocks Trading Hours\nPre-opening Session\n9:00- 9:30am\nMorning Session\n9:30am- 12:00pm\nExtended Morning Session\n12- 1pm\nAfternoon Session\n1- 4pm\nClosing Auction Session\n4:00 p.m. to a random closing between 4:08 p.m. and 4:10 p.m.\nHK Stocks Trading Fee\nStamp Duty\nGovernment 0.1%\nSFC Transaction Levy\nSFC 0.0027%\nHKEX Trading Fee\nHKEX 0.005%\nCCASS Fee\nHKSCC 0.002%\nHow do I request a securities transfer?\nIf you wish to transfer stocks to your other stock account, your sending broker might charge you a transfer fee.
