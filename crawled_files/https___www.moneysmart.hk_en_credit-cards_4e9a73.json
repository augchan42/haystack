Popular gift options including suitcases and electronic devices. For example, DBS COMPASS VISA gives you a Le Maurice suitcase and WeWa UnionPay Card gives you a Jabra wireless headphone as a welcome gift.\nHow to Choose the Best Credit Card for You in 3 Steps\nThere isn\u2019t one credit card that is better than the rest. The best card for you depends on your lifestyle and regular spending habits. Here\u2019s 3 ways to decide which card is best for you.\nStep 1\nIdentify the type of card that best fits your lifestyle\nFirstly, you want to make sure you are benefitting from the things that you spend the most money on. For example, if you spend the most on dining every month, it would make sense to get a card that maximizes the benefits you get from spending all that money eating out.\nStep 2\nUnderstand your intentions\nIt\u2019s important to think about how you intend on using your card benefits. Do you prefer immediate cash rebates? Or would you prefer to collect and redeem Asia miles? Understanding what types of benefits you\u2019d like is a major factor in deciding which card would be better for you.\nStep 3\nConsider the charges in the Terms and Conditions\nDig deeper into the card details to find one with the best overall value. For example, what is the expiry date for point redemptions? What are the international and domestic transfer fees? What is the required spending before you qualify for the sign-up bonus? These are a few of the important questions to think through as you shop for your new card.\n5 Types of Hong Kong Credit Cards\nHong Kong credit cards are from 5 major card issuers. Visa and Mastercard take up most of the market, followed by American Express, UnionPay, and JCB. Visa and Mastercard are card issuers with a long history and are accepted everywhere in the world. On the other hand, American Express can be used in 130+ countries.\nUnionPay credit cards are great for spending in China. Many Hong Kong banks have launched UnionPay dual-currency credit cards, such as HSBC UnionPay Dual Currency Credit Card and Standard Chartered UnionPay Dual Currency Platinum Credit Card to benefit frequent travelers to mainland China.\nJCB credit cards are perfect for those who travel often to Japan because they offer many discounts on spending in Japan. Currently, only BEA and AEON have launched JCB credit cards in Hong Kong.\nWhat Are the Easiest Credit Cards to Get Approved for?\nLow Income Requirement Credit Cards\nMany credit cards specify a low minimum income and some cards such as EarnMORE UnionPay Card and WeWa UnionPay Card do not specify a minimum income, which is ideal for housewives/ freelancers or tertiary school students to apply. Submitting your proof of asset increases your chances of getting approved, but you may still get approved without it.\nNo Annual Fee Credit Cards\nA credit card with no annual fee helps cardholders save on card costs and maximise the rewards cardholders earn. Cardholders can enjoy no fees for life or within the promotional period depending on the type of cards you apply.\nWhat Credit Card is Best?\nThere is no absolute for the best credit card, you should choose credit cards based on your spending habits. Pick credit cards with different spending categories based on your habits to earn the most rewards. For reward point credit cards, you can redeem cash rebates, air miles, coupons, and other gifts, giving you higher flexibility. Air miles credit cards are suitable for frequent flyers who would take the effort to research on collecting miles. Cashback credit cards are suitable for those who don\u2019t spend a lot and want to get rebates directly.\nWhich is better: Visa or Mastercard credit card?\nVisa and Mastercard credit cards are both globally accepted and offer different perks for members in different tiers, the most common types of Visa and Mastercard credit cards include Visa Platinum, Visa Signature, Visa Infinite, Titanium & Platinum Mastercard, World Mastercard and World Elite Mastercard.\nBoth Visa and Mastercard offer its own network benefits including travel, luxury hotel, dining and more when it comes to foreign spending, Mastercard often offers slightly better exchange rate, but for everyday card users, there is not much difference between Visa and Mastercard. It is suggested to find the right credit card by focusing on each card offer and perks of your choice, and be aware of annual fee, cash back, air miles or rewards that you are looking for.\nHow many credit cards can I apply for?\nThere is no absolute limit on the number of credit cards you can have. Having more than one credit card can allow you to get different credit card offers and benefits for different cards, you can also earn various rewards like air miles or cashback on your daily spending.\nHowever, applying for too many credit cards at a time can hurt your credit score and the chances of credit card approval. Even though the damage on credit scores are only temporary, if you are hoping to get a mortgage or personal loan in the coming months, it is best to keep your credit report nice and clean.\nCommon Credit Card Fees\nAnnual fees aren\u2019t the only type of credit card charges you might be paying.
