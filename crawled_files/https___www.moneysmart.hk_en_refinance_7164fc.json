Mortgage lenders can usually choose between HIBOR (Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate) plan and prime plan for refinance.\n\nIf you have already owned your property for more than two years, the valuation of your property could be backdated to when you first purchased the property. If it\u2019s worth under HK$6,000,000, the maximum LTV is 80% and you can cash out.\n\nAlthough the 2019 policy address has relaxed regulations for first-home buyers, exempting them from stress tests for high LTV, it doesn\u2019t apply to refinance. To apply for refinance, applicants must pass the stress test irrespective of LTV ratio.\nThere are two main types of refinance:\nRate-and-Term Mortgage Refinancing Loans:\nRefinance your mortgage for the remaining balance to get a better interest rate or change the terms\nCash-out Mortgage Refinancing Loans:\nTransfer your existing home loan to a new money lender and increase the loan amount to meet your other financial needs\nCompare Cash Rebate\nBOC\nP(5.0%)-2.5% H+1.5% Up to 0.8%\nHSBC\nP(5.0%)-2.5% H+1.5% Up to 0.8%\nBEA\nP(5.25%)-2.75% H+1.4% Up to 1%\nCompare All Refinance Plan and Cash Rebate\nCompare Refinance Interest Rate and Cash Rebate!\nCompare Now!\nWhy should I Refinance?\nThe benefits of Refinancing your Mortgage\n1. Cash Out\nWhen the value of your home appreciates, you can take advantage of equity built up in your home by withdrawing the difference between the two mortgages in cash.\n2. Better Mortgage Rate\nEnjoy a lower mortgage rate to save money.\n3. Earn Cash Rebate\nBesides lower interest rates, you can choose to refinance to earn cash rebate.\n4. Get Rid of Co-financing Schemes\nWith a cash-out refinance plan, homeowners can borrow against your home equity to pay off the home loan and get rid of co-financing schemes with much higher interest.\n5. Get Mortgage Link Account\nEnjoy the benefits of a Mortgage Link account to reduce some of the interest you pay on your mortgage.\nThe risks of Refinance - Things to know before you Refinance your Mortgage\nWhen interest rates are low/ when the value of your property appreciates, refinancing your home loan may seem like a no-brainer. But this decision is not made without risks. Before you decide it\u2019s time to refinance your mortgage, you need to consider below:\nPenalty Fee will be Incurred during Lock-in Period\nHome loan refinancing only makes sense when there are financial benefits. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know when your lock-in period will end. It usually lasts for 2-3 years. If you refinance your mortgage during the lock-in period, it will incur a penalty fee. You can check the exact end date in the Facility Letter. It is wise to plan ahead and shop around and start the refinancing process a few months before the new interest rate cycle kicks in.\nLost Value\nIf the LTV ratio is higher than 60%, it is mandatory to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI). If the value of your home appreciates, you may want to get rid of PMI to get back some of your premium through refinancing. However, this may not go as planned if your value of your home goes down or in case of down valuation.\nRising Interest\nIt is important to take into account the fluctuation in interest rate before you refinance your mortgage, especially for mortgage borrowers originally on an H Plan.\n\nFor H Plan mortgage borrowers, it is important to take into account two interest rates - base rate (\u2018H+_%\u2019) and ceiling interest rate (\u2018P-_\uff05\u2019). In case of rising interest rates, it is not worth it to refinance your mortgage.\n\nTo better understand the context, let's look at these scenarios:\n\nSituation 1\nInterest Rate: Low\nIf the interest rate is low, then HIBOR will remain low, without hitting the interest rate ceiling. Then it makes sense to refinance your mortgage from one bank to another, taking advantage of a better interest rate.\n\nSituation 2\nInterest Rate: High\nIn case of rising interest, you may end up paying more with a higher interest rate ceiling in the new plan. This may not be offsetted even with a Mortgage Link Account.\nContact our Mortgage Specialists today to learn more\nGet a Quote\nBasics of Refinancing\nRefinance for different types of properties\nHOS flats\nEven HOS flats without premium payment may be able to enjoy a better interest rate or cash rebate through refinance. But this needs to be approved by the Housing Authority. Please bear in mind that owners cannot obtain additional finance from the existing mortgage or extend the repayment period. Only P Plan is applicable to HOS flat owners. Refinancing is a good way for owners to get some extra cash e.g. cash rateb every time the penalty period is over.\nCo-financing Schemes\nHomeowners of new buy properties who are in lack of funds may make use of co-financing schemes offered by developers for home purchasing. This scheme usually comes with an initial attractive interest rate for 2-3 years, followed by a very high subsequent interest rate. Therefore, a lot of homeowners would like to get rid of this before the offers end. Under the 2019 policy address, property valued under HK$10,000,000 can take out a 80-90% mortgage. Although owners cannot obtain additional finance through refinance, they can switch from co-financing schemes to residential mortgage loans offered by banks.\nVillage Houses\nTo apply for refinance for village houses, it is important to take into consideration factors that will affect your mortgage application e.g. quality and down valuation. For village houses, both P Plan and H Plan are available.\nPublic Housing\nOwners of public housing may be able to enjoy a better interest rate or cash rebate through refinance. But like HOS flats this needs to be approved by the Housing Authority. Please note that owners cannot get additional finance from the existing mortgage or extend the mortgage terms.\nRefinance max LTV ratio\nHK$6M or below\n80%\nHK$6M- 8.34M\n60% (Max: HK$5M)\nHK$8.34M- 10M\nMax: HK$5M\nHK$10M\n50%\nFind your Refinance Mortgage Plan now!\nCompare Now\nWhat is a Mortgage Link Account?\nMortgage Link account is an account offered to mortgage borrowers by banks with an interest rate equivalent to the mortgage loan interest rate.
