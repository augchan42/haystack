{"content": "Short Selling 101: How-tos, Pros and Cons\nShort selling is an investment strategy used to take advantage of the bear market, but it comes with considerable risks. Traders can short a stock, a market, or a commodity, etc. via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It is not designed to \u201cbuy and hold\u201d but rather it is a short-term strategy. Short sellers could end up losing an infinite amount of money, therefore traders should think twice before taking the leap. Read on to find out more about how to short sell, its advantages and disadvantages.\nWhat is short selling?\nShort selling is an advanced investment strategy for experienced investors and traders to profit from stocks that decline in value.\n\nIt flips the conventional idea of investing i.e. buy low and sell high. Conversely, it is \"buy high and sell low\", betting that the stock price will decline. The trading is done through brokers that offer this service. To short a stock, investors need to first initiate a position by borrowing shares from a broker and you must buy the shares back in order to close the trade ideally at a lower price to repay the loaned amount to the broker.\n\nIf the price drops after the investor short sells the stock, the investor will then buy it back at a lower price and then return it to the lender. The difference between the sell price and the buy price will be the investor\u2019s profit.\n\nIf a stock\u2019s price increases, the investor will lose money. One of the biggest risks of short selling is the possibility of losing an infinite amount of money as there is no ceiling as to which a stock price can rise.\nHow can short selling make money?\nShort selling can be a good investing strategy to earn money in bear market. Investors who short sell in a falling market can earn a positive return. First, short sellers borrow shares of stocks from a brokerage. Then, they sell the borrowed shares at current market price and receive the income earned from the shares sold. Short sellers would then have to decide whether to close out the short sale by buying the exact number of shares sold to return to the brokerage, in the hope that the stock price would drop when they buy the shares such that they can earn the price difference.\n\nFor example, if an investor thinks that ABC stock is overvalued (current price: $150/share), and its price will drop. He or she can employ the short selling strategy to make profit. The investor needs to borrow some shares, say 10 from their broker and then sell them. \n\nIf the stock does go down to $100, the investor could buy the 10 shares back at this price, return the borrowed shares to their broker, and make $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). However, if the share price increases to $200, the investor would have to pay a higher price to buy back the shares borrowed, making a loss of $500 ($2,000 - $1,500).\n\nPlease beware that short selling is high risk trading strategy and does not guarantee profits.\nHow to short sell?\nAfter you have evaluated the risks of short selling, you may follow the steps below to short sell:\nStep 1\nDecide whether you want to short shares or derivatives\nStep 2\nSet up a margin account\nStep 3\nOpen a position to \u2018sell\u2019 the product you want to short\nStep 4\nMonitor the market situation to determine if your prediction was correct\nStep 5\nIf the stock price drops, close your position by buying back the shares and earn the difference\nStep 6\nIf the stock price rises, close your position by buying back the shares and pay the difference\nPros of short selling\nPotentially earning profit during bull market\nShort sellers can benefit from a potential decline in an investment. Short selling can be used as speculation or hedging, to help protect gains or mitigate losses in your investment portfolio.\nLittle initial funds required\nShort selling allows investors to earn a significant profit without substantial initial funds. Only the brokerage fee is required upfront, and the rest can be covered when you close the deal.\nCons of short selling\nRisk of infinite losses\nTheoretically, short sellers can lose an infinite amount of money because there is no limit to which a stock price can rise.\nRisk of margin call\nWhen the value of the securities in your margin account is running low, you will need to add additional funds into it to avoid a margin call.\nWhat is an inverse ETF?\nAn inverse ETF is an exchange traded fund (ETF) consisting of different derivatives with the objective of delivering inverse returns of underlying indexes. Inverse ETFs only seek investment results that are the opposite of their benchmarks' performances for one day only. For example, if an inverse ETF seeks to track the performance of Nasdaq 100 index.
