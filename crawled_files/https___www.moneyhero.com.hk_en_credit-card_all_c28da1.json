Cardholders must repay the borrowed money, sometimes including interest and charges, either in full by the billing date or over time. Interest is charged on the amount spent, and the borrowing limits are generally based on the cardholder's credit rating. \n    What is a co-branded credit card?\n\n \nSponsored by two parties with both their logos featured in the card, a co-branded credit card is a card offered in partnership between a retailer or business and a credit card issuing organisation. These co-branded credit cards can be used wherever the associated credit card network, such as Visa,  Mastercard, JCB, Union Pay, or American Express, is accepted. \n  To issue a co-branded credit card, the merchant or organisation generally partners with a licensed bank that provides the actual credit in Hong Kong. These cards may provide rewards on purchases made with the specific business, serving as incentives to encourage cardholders to become loyal customers. The benefits and perks usually include discounts, shopping points, free delivery, and advance notice of sales, similar to store-specific cards.\n    What is a credit card issuer?\n\n\nA credit card issuer is a financial institution, such as a bank or credit union, that provides cards and credit limits to individuals and businesses, and enables cardholders to pay for goods and services. They act as intermediaries between credit card networks and cardholders, facilitating card issuance.\n\nCredit card issuers not only issue cards but also manage cardholder accounts. This includes processing transactions, sending statements, and handling customer inquiries. \n\nMoneyHero has also partnered with Hong Kong's biggest and most trusted card issuers.\n\n  What are credit card networks?\n\n\nCredit card networks facilitate transactions between merchants and card issuers, creating payment infrastructures and charging interchange fees. Networks determine card acceptance and may also offer partnerships in travel, transportation, dining, and entertainment, providing perks and benefits based on cardholder terms.\n\nThere are 5 major credit card networks in Hong Kong - Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay, and JCB. The banks which issue the credit cards often offer rewards programmes where cardholders can accumulate points, cash back, or air miles on card spending and points are often redeemable for various benefits. \n    What To Consider When Applying For A Credit Card?\n\nWhen choosing a credit card, it's important to consider your needs and preferences. Take into account factors such as card popularity, available offers, bank reputation, and card classification. Determine the purpose of the card, whether it's for online purchases, holiday expenses, or bill payments. One more factor to consider would be your spending habits.
