The relevant third party reserves the final right to decide whether or not to accept your offer.\nWe aim to give you uninterrupted access to the current Services.  However, we cannot assure you of uninterrupted availability of the Services. We have the absolute right to suspend, limit or terminate your access to the Services at any time.\nWe reserve the right to feature, amend, delete, edit, discontinue or modify the Services and/or any data, content, material or information displayed on the Services at any time without further notice.

MHGL wholly owns MHIBL, and both are members of the group of companies comprising the Hyphen Group.  MHIBL is an authorized insurance broker and its business is to arrange insurance products and services for its clients.  MHIBL does not represent any particular insurance company in its dealings with clients.  MHIBL is not an insurance company and does not underwrite any insurance risk, nor does it represent any insurance company in its dealings with you.  MHIBL will handle all enquiries relating to contracts of insurance or insurance related matters on the Services.  Other than the provision of marketing services to virtual insurance companies, MHGL does not carry on an insurance business and all insurance related activities on the Services are carried out by MHIBL.  \nFor your information, MHIBL is remunerated for its services by the receipt of commission(s) paid by insurers.  Your agreement to use the Services and to proceed with any insurance transaction through the Services shall constitute your consent to the receipt of commission by MHIBL.\n\nInformation about Insurance Products\nAny contract to obtain an insurance product will be entered into between you and the relevant insurance provider.  All products and services described on the Services or arranged by MHIBL are subject to the terms and conditions of the contract between you and the applicable insurance provider. You are advised to read these terms and conditions carefully and to satisfy yourself that you understand such terms and conditions thoroughly (and in appropriate cases, seek professional advice on the meaning, operation and substantive effect of these terms and conditions) before you enter a contract for such products or services.  If you are in doubt as to your obligations under these Terms and Conditions or if you wish to seek assistance in relation to our services, you are encouraged to contact our customer service department.\nNo insurance coverage shall be construed as bound, in force, applied for or assumed as a result of your submission of data to MHGL and/or MHIBL on the Services or otherwise unless and until notification of coverage has been sent to you by MHGL and/or MHIBL or the relevant insurance company/provider.\nUnless otherwise specified, products and services described in this Website are not available to persons who are outside Hong Kong SAR or to persons who do not possess legal capacity to enter into contracts, such as minors, and accordingly, no contract purported to be entered by these persons will bind MHIBL or MHGL.\nWhere appropriate and with your consent, all documents related to insurance products may be sent to you electronically.  In cases where insurance documents cannot be delivered electronically due to legal constraints, physical forms will be posted to you upon your request.\nInformation on the Services and all materials pertaining to products and services on offer are not representative of, and thus must not be treated as a complete description of the particular and individual terms and conditions of, nor the precise cover provided by the relevant product or service.  It is your sole responsibility to seek independent and professional advice and to ensure all details and information provided to us and displayed on the Services are accurate and reliable.  With respect to any specific product or service, the terms and conditions of the provider of that product or service shall prevail should contradictions arise with the information set out on the Services.\nPrior to any cover being confirmed or provided to you, you should fully and faithfully inform MHIBL of everything you know, or could reasonably be expected to know that could be relevant in the process or the decision to grant you the requested insurance.  You are obliged (i) to disclose every fact which would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the premium or determining whether to underwrite the risk; (ii) not to misrepresent material facts and (iii) not to make fraudulent claims.  A fact is material and requires disclosure to the insurer (even if not asked or prompted by the insurer in the proposal form or any other communication between you and the insurer, whether through MHIBL or not) if it is relevant to the nature of the risk sought to be covered.  To do otherwise may result in receiving no benefit from your chosen policy.\nYou agree that submission of your information on our Services shall never in any way be considered as an acceptance of any offer and/or your request to purchase any product or service, and that nothing on the Services shall be treated as an invitation to do any of these actions.  MHIBL's request for a policy shall not be construed as an offer by MHIBL to provide a product to you.\nYou must read and accept all applicable terms, conditions, exclusions, and limitations of any policy before entering any agreement or arrangement with an insurer.\nBy proceeding with the purchase of an insurance product through the Services you authorise MHGL & MHIBL to pass your personal data to Stripe, our third party payment gateway service provider (or any replacement or successor payment gateway provider) to charge your credit card account through Stripe for the amount of the insurance premium.\nWith respect to insurance products, it is your responsibility to read all applicable terms and conditions, including any relating to time periods in which premiums may (or may not) be refunded.  \n\nMobile Services\nThe Services include certain services that may be available through a mobile device, including (i) the ability to submit information to the Services via a mobile device and (ii) the ability to browse the Services and the Website from a mobile device (together, the \u201cMobile Services\u201d).
