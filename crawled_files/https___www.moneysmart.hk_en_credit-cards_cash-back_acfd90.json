Earn 2% on local and foreign currency spending. Also eligible for 1% rebate on e-wallet transaction (PayMe, WeChat Pay, AliPay, Octopus Card). Cardholders can also enjoy all Visa Signature Privileges.\nCan We Get Unlimited Cashback?\nIn most cases, no. Cashback credit cards reward you with cash rebates based on your spending amount. This amount is credited to your account, giving you a discount off your credit card bill. Some banks may link cashback to their reward point schemes, giving you a choice between cash rebate and gifts. For some banks, you can pay cash dollars at selected merchants as cash. Even though some cash back credit cards have limits, but here are 3 tips for you to maximize it:\nTip 1\nBasic cashback\nSome cash back credit cards may set a minimum spend for getting cash rebates. Some banks may set a cap on cashback amount or certain categories.\nTip 2\nBonus cashback\nMany banks partner with merchants to launch joint offers from time to time. These are awarded on top of the base cash rebate and can be pretty high. Note that some banks may set a spending requirement, plus you need to register in advance to get the cashback offer.\nTip 3\nIntroductory offers\nYou\u2019ll get cashbacks as a welcome offer for applying for new credit cards. Note that banks usually set a spending requirement, and you can\u2019t cancel their credit cards over the past 6-12 months. For the welcome cash rewards, banks will transfer it to your credit card account in a few months.\nHang Seng Cash Dollars V.S. enJoy Dollars V.S. Merchant Dollars\nWith Hang Seng credit cards, cardholders can earn Cash Dollars for every spending, which can be used to offset spending at over 7,600 designated merchant outlets in Hong Kong. At designated merchants such as Sa Sa, Mirabell, etc., cardholders can even earn Merchant Dollars on top of Cash Dollars for every spending. Please be reminded that Merchant Dollars can only be used at the same designated merchants as instant cash.\nCash Rebate vs Cash Back\nCash Back\nSome cards offer cardholders cash back for their spending. The cashback earned will be automatically used to offset spending in the cardholders\u2019 next month bill. For example, Blue Cash\u2120 Credit Card from American Express offers 1.2% Cashback on daily purchases, which will be credited to the cardholder's account automatically to offset spending.\nCash Rebate\nSome cards offer cardholders cash rebate for their spending, which will be stored in the credit card account until cardholders decide to redeem it to offset further purchases. For example, Hang Seng enJoy Card offers cash rebate in the form of enJoy Dollars. Cardholders can tell the merchant to use the enJoy Dollars earned to offset purchases.\nWhat credit card gives the most cash back?\nWhat credit card gives the most cash back?\nIn general, most credit cards around 0.4% to 1% rebate, which is HK$0.4 to HK$1 cash back. Some credit cards may focus on certain spending categories, such as entertainment, spending in foreign currency, and dining etc., offering up to 4 to 5% cashback. For example, WeWa Union Pay Card offers up to 4% Cash Rebate for spending in specific categories (\u201cTravel\u201d, \u201cCinema\u201d, \u201cKaraoke\u201d and \u201cTheme Park\u201d) throughout the year.\nHow do cashback credit cards work?\nCashback credit cards give you a cash rebate for eligible spending. Card issuers can afford to give cardholders cash back because of the interchange fees that merchants pay for each transaction. Some cashback cards offer bonus categories and tiered rewards. Some of them also have a minimum spend requirement and a cashback cap.\nWhat does it mean to get cash back on a credit card?\nCashback credit cards are effortless and simple to use since the cashback is automatically credited into your credit card account. Some banks also link cashback to their reward points scheme, such as Hang Seng. Cash Dollars can be used as coupons or cash at selected merchants.\nAre cashback cards worth it?\nThe best thing about cashback credit cards is that you don\u2019t need to worry about the expiry date of points. All cashback will be credited directly into your credit card account. Unlike air miles and gifts, you don\u2019t need to pay extra fees for redeeming.\nWhat is the best cashback credit card with no annual fee?\nBefore getting a cashback credit card, sort out your spending habits and frequent spending categories. For example, people who frequently shop on enJoy card designated merchants, Hang Seng enJoy Card can be a good option.\nHomeCredit CardsCash Back\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
