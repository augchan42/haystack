This is a good strategy because investors can benefit from dollar-cost average. Saving and investing monthly is a good way to start investing \u2013 it becomes habit forming. When the investor dollar-cost averages, he/she invests an equal amount in the market monthly. Instead of trying to time the market, the investor buys in at a range of different price points, as opposed to investing a large lump sum all at one time. However, not all platforms accept buying US stocks monthly. Now, in Hong Kong, only a few platforms including uSmart and CHIEF Group allow investors to buy stocks monthly.\nUS Stocks Trading Hours\nSummer Time (Mar- Nov)\n9:30 pm - 4 am Hong Kong Time Monday to Friday\nWinter Time (Nov- Mar)\n10:30 pm - 5 am Hong Kong Time Monday to Friday\nBenefits of Hong Kong People Investing in the US Stocks Market\nWide Range of World-Renowned Stocks\nThere are a wide range of world-renowned companies in the US stock markets including Apple, Google, Amazon for investors to choose from.\nLower Investment Threshold\nIn the Hong Kong stock market, investors are required to buy at least \u201cone lot\u201d of the stock, which may be equivalent to 100 shares, 500 shares, etc., depending upon the stock price.
