Some policies only cover climbing up to a certain height or diving up to a specific depth so don\u2019t forget to check the details of sports coverage first.\nMaking a Travel Claim\nMost insurers will require the insurer to make the claim within 30 days of the occurrence. Whatever you are choosing to make a claim for, you are required to submit proofs such as receipts for lost or stolen items, boarding pass for delayed flights, police reports for theft, etc.\nTravel Alert\nThe Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) System aims to help prospective travelers better understand the risk or threat to your personal safety in traveling. If you purchased the travel insurance prior to the issuance of travel alert, your travel will be covered for trip cancellation or forced termination of your trip.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen should you buy travel insurance when planning a trip to Thailand?\nTo ensure you enjoy the maximum protection, you should buy your travel insurance ideally at the same time when you book your air tickets and accommodation.\nDoes travel insurance cover licensed diving?\nYes. Most Travel insurance covers general amateur sports and activities. Some set a limit on the depth of dive but some don\u2019t.\nWill travel insurance cover my loss for unauthorised use of my credit card while I\u2019m away?\nYes. Most insurance products cover loss of money or unauthorised use of credit cards.\nI felt sick while I was abroad but I did not consult a doctor. I only did so when I came back to Hong Kong from Thailand. Am I covered?\nIn most cases, no. The medical expenses incurred after your return to Hong Kong are not covered.\nWhat is the outbound travel alert?\nOutbound Travel Alert or \u201cOTA\u201d refers the 3 colour-coded alerts i.e. the \u201cAmber Alert\u201d(Signs of threat), \u201cRed Alert\u201d (Significant threat) and \u201cBlack Alert\u201d (Severe threat) issued by the Hong Kong government under the Outbound Travel Alert System.\nWhat is not covered in travel insurance?\nIf you got the travel insurance prior to the issuance of a travel alert, your travel will be covered for trip cancellation or forced termination of your trip.\nWhat extra protection can I receive if a travel alert is issued for the planned destination?\nYou should buy travel insurance as soon as you book your holiday. This is to make sure you get your trip insured in case of accidents.\nHomeTravel InsuranceBest Thailand Travel Insurance 2024\nAbout Careers Contact Us\nDisclaimer: At MoneySmart, MoneySmart HK Limited will do a variety of product listing services including but not limited to credit cards, personal loans, home loans and all products from virtual insurance companies.\nFollow us\n\u00a9 2009-2024 MoneySmart.
