They also protect the insured from different types of travel disruptions, such as travel delays, baggage loss, and trip cancellation. Losses of personal money and travel documents are also covered if they are caused by accidents covered under the specific insurance policy. Other Hong Kong Travel Insurance protections include compensation on rental vehicle excess, theft of mobile devices, and personal liability.\nIt is essential to look at the major exclusions in the terms of the policy before purchasing a Hong Kong Travel Insurance plan. If the above situations are caused by events listed under \u201cMajor Exclusions\u201d, the insured usually won\uff07t be compensated by the Hong Kong travel insurance company. Some common major exclusions are war, civil war, acts of foreign enemies, rebellion, military or usurped power, nuclear hazards, acts of terrorism, and pre-existing, congenital and hereditary conditions.\nIf the insured will participate in leisure and sports activities during his/her trip, he/she should check in advance whether the activity falls into the scope of \u201chigh-risk activities\u201d that are usually listed under \u201cMajor Exclusions\u201d in the policy terms, such as trekking at an altitude limit greater than 5,000 meters above sea level or diving to a depth greater than 30 meters below sea level.\nNormally, Hong Kong travel insurance plans require any activities in the air, unless an insured person is traveling as a fare-paying passenger in a licensed aircraft operated by a recognised airline, or participating in an activity of which the maneuver or navigation is managed and controlled by another licensed person and the provider of such activity, to be authorized by the relevant local authority.\nPart 3 : How to claim travel insurance online?\nStep 1: Check the time limit for submitting claim form\nTravel insurance companies usually require you to make the claim within a specific time limit, usually within 21 to 30 days of the occurrence.\nStep 2: Prepare original documents / proofs / reports\nHere are some common documents that are needed for claiming travel insurance online. Each insurance company may have their own list of required documents, please checkout their official website for specific requirements. Click here to find the contact information of the insurance companies.\nDocuments required for medical claims: Boarding pass (shows the travel period), official medical receipt (with detailed medical expanse), medical report and detailed diagnostic report / referral letter / discharge certificate from a registered doctor.\nDocuments required for flight delay / baggage delay: Flight tickets and boarding pass with the actual boarding time, delay confirmation report issued by the airline, official receipt of the additional expense due to the delay (e.g. hotel).\nDocuments required for lost / damage of personal belongings: Clear photo of the lost / damaged item, purchase receipt, repair receipt, boarding pass.\nStep 3: Download and fill in the claim form\nStep 4: Upload the claim form and related documents to the insurance company\u2019s official website\nPart 4 : How to compare travel insurance? \nAn all-rounded travel insurance that is suitable for you can save you from a lot of trouble from handling travel incidents, so you can devote more time to enjoying your vacation or business trip. Employers should also select travel insurance that is catered for employees who travel for business consistently to protect the interests of both parties.\nPlease keep in mind that insurance companies may have some exclusions in the travel insurance policies. Therefore, price should not be your only concern when selecting a suitable travel insurance. You should also pay attention to items that are not covered in your policies so you can plan ahead and avoid unexpected expenses. For example, you should check if the Hong Kong Government issued any Outbound Travel Alert to certain politically unstable countries and if the travel insurance policy covers any accidents that occur in countries under Outbound Travel Alert.\nThere are 2 major things you need to consider when comparing travel insurance, your travel destination and your travel activities.\nOutbound Travel Alert / Terrorist Attack\nThe Hong Kong Government introduced The Outbound Travel Alert System to help people better understand the risk or threat to personal safety in traveling to popular travel destinations. It classified countries / territories into 3 alert levels, Amber, Red and Black, based on the severity of the threat in a place that may affect personal safety. \nSome travel insurance plans cover countries that are under Outbound Travel Alert, normally there will be compensation for the expenses from trip cancellations due to the issue of Travel Alert before departure, and the accommodation charges and additional expenses from curtailment of trip. However, you should pay attention to the terms and conditions of reimbursement, as some travel insurance only covers Black Outbound Alert. Not all travel insurance policies cover the acts of terrorism, and even if it does, it is not applicable under certain circumstances. \nThe definition of acts of terrorism\nEach travel insurance company may have their own definition of acts of terrorism. Some of them may see whether war, military power, nuclear weapons etc. are involved. War is generally not covered, only Allied World covers war that occurs during the journey, while AXA, Blue Cross, FWD, MSIG, STARR and Zurich do not cover any acts of terrorism related to nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or radioactive contamination. However, as long as the government in your destination declared the event as acts of terrorism, even though the event only involves common terrorist attacks like guns and bombs, there is still a high possibility of a successful claim.\nSelf-driving tours\nExcluded in third-party liability insurance\nMost insurance companies will offer third-party liability insurance but not covering self-driving tours with rental cars as the medical and personal accident benefits are only applicable to the  insured person. Overseas car rental companies would usually purchase car insurance for their rental cars, which already covers personal accidents, traffic accidents and third-party assets.\nRental Vehicle Excess\nIn case of traffic accidents, part of the repair cost may be self-financed, those are usually referred to as \u201cCollision Damage Waiver Excess\u201d or \u201cRental Vehicle Excess\u201d, which is determined by the car rental company and the rest are compensated by the insurance company.
