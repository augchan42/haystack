When choosing travel insurance plans for your holiday, the cheapest policy available is not always the best choice. Buying travel insurance based on your needs is essential, but here are several factors to consider depending on your priorities:\nSingle V.S. Annual Travel Insurance\nIf you can see yourself travelling multiple times, at least 3 to 4 trips in the coming year, you may consider annual travel insurance instead of single trip insurance.\n\nBesides saving some cash, you can also save time since there is no need to shop for a new policy every time before you go.\nAdd-on coverage\nOther than basic cover like trip cancellation, baggage loss etc., if you are doing any special activities or sports, like sky-diving or bungee-jumping, you may need extra cover to get full protection on the medical expenses or personal accident.\n\nIf you are going on a cruise, you may also need to upgrade your policy so to get missed departure, cruise itinerary change or more cover.\n\nLast but not least, during the coronavirus pandemic, it's essential to buy a travel insurance that provides COVID-19 coverage.\nCheck the limits and excess\nMost travel insurance cover has its own limits and requirements, take travel delay as an example, you can only get compensation if the delay meets the required numbers of hours in the travel insurance policy.\n\nSome of the coverage items like rental vehicle protection usually require excess which is the amount you will need to pay before making a claim.\nWhat does travel insurance from HK cover?\nMedical expenses\nIf you unexpectedly suffer an injury or sickness on your trip and need to visit the doctor or hospital abroad, travel insurance will cover treatment expenses incurred.\nTrip cancellations and delay\nLook for a policy that is able to compensate you for any flight delay, cancellation, or disruption. This will help to tide you over the inconvenience caused before you get on your next flight.\nLoss of baggage and personal items\nLosing your luggage can be a huge nightmare. Most policies should cover you for lost, delayed or damaged baggage, but if you are bringing expensive items along, make sure you get add-on insurance for those items too.\nPersonal accident\nThis travel insurance coverage starts even before you embark on your trip, and provides reimbursement should you encounter an accident.\nPersonal Liability\nIf an insured person is involved in legal liability of causing a loss or damage to the third parties, personal liability coverage in travel insurance will be able to help with the compensation and expenses.\nHigh risk sports coverage\nGoing to climb a mountain? Decided to give skydiving a try? Make sure your travel insurance covers you for the activity you are doing. Some policies only cover climbing up to a certain height so be sure to check the details of sports coverage first.\nCOVID-19 protection\nVarious travel insurance offers COVID-19 protection which is vital during the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 cover ranges from emergency overseas medical expenses, journey cancellation and curtailment in relation to COVID-19, and quarantine allowance.\nExclusions in Travel Insurance\nLike every other insurance, travel insurance has its exclusions and special conditions which the insurance company see as a higher risk, therefore the coverage is not eligible under those conditions. Here are several common categories of exclusions in a travel insurance policy:\nWar, revolution, use of military power, riot\nIntentional acts including suicide or not taking reasonable efforts to minimize or avoid injury\nPregnancy, childbirth or any associated injury or sickness\nPre-existing or undeclared medical conditions\nSpecific medical conditions including sexually transmitted disease like AIDS or mental disorder\nAlcohol or medicine related accidents, unless those are under prescription\nProfessional sports\nHigh-risk activities\nUnattended belongings\nMaking a Travel Insurance Claim\nThe process for specific types of claims may differ between Insurers. However, policies offered by popular insurers such as AXA, MSIG, FWD or AIG generally have similar Travel Insurance Claims procedures. Here are some things that you should take note of when making an insurance claim.\nFact #1\nDo not wait too long\nMost insurers will require you to make the claim within 30 days of the occurrence. Given that it will take some time to process your claim, you would want to submit your claim form as soon as possible.\nFact #2\nKeep originals\nWhatever you are choosing to make a claim for, you have to be able to prove its authenticity. This means showing proof of the following examples:\nReceipts for lost or stolen items\nBoarding pass for delayed flights\nBooking Invoices from Travel sites for cancelled trips\nHospital or Doctor\u2019s bills for medical claims\nPolice reports for theft\nFact #3\nGet proof from external parties\nApart from your own documents, it\u2019s extremely important to get written confirmation from external parties such as the airline you were flying on or the hotel you stayed at as proof of travel disruption, for instance. This will help to expedite the claims process.\nFact #4\nGet insurer to accept medical claim\nIf you have encountered medical conditions overseas, when it\u2019s not an emergency situation, make sure to call the insurance company and get them to accept the claim first, so then you will less likely get a rejected claim.\nFact #5\nCall the police ASAP for theft\nWhen your luggage or belongings are lost or stolen, you are required to contact local police within 24 hours after the theft takes place and get a written police report. Pay attention that unattended belongings may not be covered as it is considered as personal responsibility.\nHK Travel Insurance Tips\nHere are some Travel Insurance tips that can help you select a great policy and give you peace of mind when travelling out of Hong Kong.\nAre flight delays always covered?\nCheck if you can make claims on flight delays that are caused by natural disasters, such as typhoons. You will not be covered if you did not purchase your plan before the typhoon signal is issued -- so buy coverage as soon as your trip is finalized.\nHow long can I get my claims back?\nDid you know that in certain cases, you can make claims and get your money back within a few hours? For example, if you get MSIG travel insurance and rent a car in Japan, you could make a claim much faster (just a few hours)!\nAre mobile devices covered?\nA majority of travel insurance plans do not provide coverage on accidental loss of mobile devices.

Airline and hotel comparison websites may also provide complimentary or discounted travel insurance when you book your flight or hotel on their platform. Although you may save some time and cost through such kind of bundle deal, the travel insurance options on those sites are usually rather limited. You may also not get the type of protection that specifically caters to your travel needs.\n\nOn MoneySmart, you can compare different travel insurance plans at one glance, from the types and amount of coverage to premiums.
