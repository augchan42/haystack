Is there any vaccination or other requirements?\nIn the post-pandemic days, it is vital to read the terms and conditions carefully before purchasing travel insurance. Pay attention to the following:\nWhether you need to meet the vaccination requirements in Hong Kong or at your destination\nMinimum number of vaccination doses\nHow far in advance should I get a travel insurance?\nIf tested positive for Covid-19, whether a rapid test result / PCR / proof from a recognised local government medical authority would be accepted\n  Can I get a refund for my travel insurance if I cancel my trip?\nGenerally speaking, once a travel insurance purchase has been approved, the premium paid cannot be refunded. However, some insurers may use their discretion for special cases, so please check with the insurer for details.\nDoes travel insurance cover sudden flight cancellation by airline?\nOnly the reasons of flight cancellation that are listed in the insurer\u2019s terms and conditions are covered. As sudden flight cancellation by airlines is usually not related to the covered causes, such as strike, bad weather and mechanical failure, most of the travel insurance products do not cover flight cancellations by airlines. Therefore, you are advised to take this into account when choosing an airline.\nWhat does travel insurance generally cover if I am tested positive for Covid-19 during my trip?\nMedical expenses / hospital admission deposit / hospital cash allowance\nJourney curtailment / cancellation\nFollow-up medical expenses upon return to Hong Kong\nCompulsory quarantine cash allowance\nHow to make a claim if I am tested positive for Covid-19 overseas after departure or after returning to Hong Kong? What are the steps to file a claim?\nMost travel insurance policies cover medical expenses, including overseas medical fees and hospital cash allowance.\nIf you are infected with Covid-19 while travelling, you should seek medical treatment at the local hospital first.\nKeep all medical reports, supporting documents and receipts upon discharging from the hospital so that you can claim when you return to Hong Kong. Insurers usually require the insured to receive initial local treatment before covering the cost of follow-up treatment upon returning to Hong Kong.\nIf the diagnosis is confirmed within 7 days of the return (depending on the insurance company) with mandatory quarantine, some insurers would offer a cash allowance and medical coverage.\nFAQ for purchasing Covid-19 travel insurance\nWhich is the best travel insurance plan with Covid-19 coverage?\nIn the post-pandemic era, deciding which is the best Covid-19 travel insurance plan depends on the insured's needs.
