If the insured is required to undergo compulsory quarantine because he/she has tested positive for COVID-19, or because his/her family member(s) and/or partner has/have tested positive with COVID-19, the insured can be compensated for up to HK$50,000 for non-refundable transportation and accommodation expenses.\nMedical Expenses\nWhen traveling, especially during the pandemic, it is essential to get travel insurance that covers COVID-19. Otherwise, if you end up being hospitalized due to COVID-19 in a foreign country, you will have to bear all related medical expenses yourself. To avoid this, you need to get travel insurance that covers COVID-19.\n\nThere is no lack of such travel insurance. For example, Zurich Travel VIVA Insurance Plan covers up to HK$1,500,000 medical expenses as a result of COVID-19.\nMandatory quarantine during your travel due to COVID-19\nSome travel insurance provides cover if you or your family members or partners is/are tested positive for COVID-19, and as a result is/are required to undergo compulsory quarantine. The insured can be compensated for non refundable transportation and accommodation expenses.\n\nIn addition, the AXA SmartTraveller Plus Economy Plan (Single Journey) will automatically be extended for up to 10 days, so your policy will still be valid even if you are in quarantine.\nCompulsory quarantine due to COVID-19 upon arrival in Hong Kong\nIf the insured is infected with COVID-19 overseas, or is diagnosed with an overseas infection within a specified period of time (usually within 14 days) after returning to Hong Kong, and is required to undergo mandatory quarantine, some insurance companies will provide the insured with mandatory quarantine cash allowance and cover follow-up medical expenses upon arrival in Hong Kong, but generally it only applies to community isolation facilities and does not apply to hotel or home quarantine.\n\nRemember to read the insurance terms and conditions before purchasing your travel insurance in order to get the most suitable travel insurance for yourself.\nLoss of travel document\nIf the insured loses his/her travel document, some travel insurance such as Allianz Travel - Gold Plan will cover the replacement cost, or additional transportation and accommodation expenses as a result of this.
