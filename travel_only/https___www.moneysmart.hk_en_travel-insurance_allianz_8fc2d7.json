Moreover, it provides the following perks, giving you and your family the protection needed on your vacation from unforeseen circumstances:\nAutomatic COVID-19 Cover\nAllianz Travel comes with COVID-19 cover, providing coverage from medical expenses to overseas hospital daily cash and from emergency medical assistance to cancellation of journey, giving you peace of mind in case of any disruption to your trip because of Covid-19.\nExtensive Coverage\nAllianz Travel provides coverage even for air miles & loyalty card points , travel delay allowance after only 5 hours (less than the threshold set by other travel insurance provider), and also theft of mobile devices - which are not always covered by other travel insurance products.\n24/7 Emergency Assistance Services\nIf you need any emergency assistance, Allianz has got you covered no matter which time zone you are in. In this way, you can always reach out should you need advice on your travel insurance.\nFast and easy claim process\nAllianz Travel Insurance offers a fast and easy way for insurers to submit a claim - which saves insurers a lot of hassles down the line.\nSingle Trip Travel Insurance VS Annual Trip Travel Insurance\nWhich one should I buy? - Single Trip Travel Insurance VS Annual Trip Travel Insurance\nSingle Trip Travel Insurance: suitable for travellers who only travel occasionally\nAnnual Cover: for travellers who travel frequently.\nAllianz Travel Insurance provides both and the Allianz Annual Trip Plan allows insurers to take an unlimited number of overseas trips over a 12 month period. However, each trip can only last for 90 days max.\nWhat is the difference between Allianz Single Trip Travel Insurance VS Annual Cover?\nAllianz Single Trip Travel Insurance comes with 3 tiers: Bronze, Silver and Gold - with medical coverage starting with HK$1 million Annual Cover only comes with 2 tiers: Silver and Gold - with medical coverage with HK$1.5 million.\nIn terms of the coverage, they are the same. Both offer coverage on medical expenses, overseas hospital daily cash benefits, emergency medical assistance, personal accident and delay and cancellation, loss and damage with the following key features:\nCancellation benefits up to HK$ 40,000\nMileage and other redeemed ticket are covered in case of cancellation\nMedical expenses up to HK$2,000,000\nTerrorist attack coverage\nMobile loss due to theft is covered\nShould I get Allianz Annual Cover or Single Trip Cover?\nIf you compare the cost of Allianz Annual & Single travel insurance plans, you will find that the cost of the Annual Plan - Bronze is on average almost 6 times more expensive than the Single Cover.\nIn other words, you will only benefit financially from getting an Annual Travel Insurance if you do decide to travel up to or more than 6 times a year. If not, it is cheaper to buy single travel insurance.\nPros and Cons\nWith that said, If you travel multiple times a year, you do need to purchase single travel insurance every time you go on holiday. If you buy annual cover, it can save you the hassle from buying travel insurance every time you travel.\nHow to Claim Allianz Travel insurance?\nYou can make a claim through the Allianz eclaims portal. To submit a claim, you can simply go to the Allianz website and click the button provided to be directed to the eclaims site and start the process of submitting your claim online.
